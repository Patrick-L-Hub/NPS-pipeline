Two separate mountain ranges are visible to the east and west. Ten campsites are spread out over the entirety of the two-mile loop trail, and are marked by brown wooden posts that emerge straight up from the ground. Fixed to these posts are small square signs with campsite numbers ranging from 1-10, arrows pointing in the direction of each site, and a small brown square showing two white silhouettes of gender-neutral hikers with walking sticks and backpacks. The sites themselves are located in the inner dune areas, which are the flat low points between dunes. The ground here is hard-packed, firmer, and often slightly darker than the soft white sand found in the dunes themselves. In some of the sites and along parts of the trail, you can find bushels of varying types of grasses, which tend to be around 1-2 feet tall and dark green and tan in color. There may also be other types of vegetation along the trail and in the campsites, including the soaptree yucca. Depending on the season, the yucca have two main components: their bayonet leaves, which are dark green, about an inch wide, and sharp enough at the tips to warrant their name; and the stem, which is a tall, woody feature that stands vertically from the base and is often over five feet tall. When a stem is present, many creamy white flowers rest on its tip. The flower petals harden after they bloom in late spring, and transform into firm capsules that house the yucca\u2019s dark brown, round seeds. Each site is marked by a bright orange post that protrudes from the ground, with the site number on it.",

The man was a social force of nature, well-known in Cambridge, Boston, and beyond. Lauded for his understanding of Russian drama, his writings, and his lectures, Harry was a respected teacher, author and preservationist. As the grandson of the poet, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, and the author, Richard Henry Dana, Jr., it seemed inevitable that Harry, too, would grow up to be an intelligent, thoughtful young man with literary inclinations. He loved to share these passions through teaching. As a gay man, he was an advocate for younger men as they navigated the social circles of elite Harvard and Cambridge. He fought unendingly for laborers and unions, traveled the world many times in his life, and saw the outbreak of World War I while in Germany. Later in life, after being dismissed from Columbia University for his pacifist views, he began to live and work in his grandfather's home. Longfellow House-Washington's Headquarters National Historic Site is preserved today thanks to his endless efforts to protect his family's legacy. He collected objects, photos, correspondence and countless other items to tell the comprehensive story of the two branches of his family -- the Longfellows and the Danas. By necessity, his story is often told through these collections, an archive of his own life, maintained and cultivated by him while he was still alive. Harry lives on in its stacks, its papers, in its rooms which echo the history of the home.",

                "bodyText": "Dana rose to fame as the author of Two Years Before the Mast, and spent his legal career advocating for the rights of sailors and the abolition of slavery. Richard Henry Dana, Jr. was born in Cambridge at 6 Green St., the second child of Richard Henry Dana, Sr. and Ruth Charlotte (Smith) Dana.\u00a0He attended schools in Cambridgeport and Westford, MA. He entered Harvard College but became embroiled in a student rebellion at the end of his second term and was suspended for six months. He returned to Harvard and at the end of his sophomore year contracted measles which apparently damaged his eyes. Richard resolved to go to sea as a sailor before the mast: \"I can hardly tell which predominated, a desire to cure my eyes, my love of adventure & the attraction of the novelty of a life before the mast, or anxiety to escape from the depressing situation of inactivity & dependence at home.\" Dana left Boston August 14, 1834 on the brig Pilgrim, sailed around Cape Horn and along the California coast,\u00a0and returned two years later on September 22, 1836 on the Alert. Dana wrote an account of his trip in 1838 and Two Years Before the Mast was published in 1840. The success of his story and the subsequent publication of The Seaman's Friend established Dana's reputation as a writer and a supporter of the fair treatment of sailors. After his long absence, Dana returned to Harvard as a senior and graduated in 1837 with excellent grades and prizes. He went on to enter the Dane Law School at Harvard and studied with Judge Joseph Story and Professor Simon Greenleaf. He left the law school in 1840 and went into the law office of Charles Greely Loring. In 1854, he\u00a0was a leading defense lawyer for freedom seeker\u00a0Anthony Burns, in an unsuccessful effort to prevent Burns's return to slavery.\u00a0In 1862, Dana successfully argued the case of the Amy Warwick before the U.S. Supreme Court, thereby ratifying the Federal blockade against southern shipping. After 1866 his legal practice was sufficiently successful so as to achieve financial security. In 1852, his neighbor and friend Henry Longfellow observed of Dana:\u00a0\"His head is full of politics. It is impossible to resist the fascinations of dealing with the great active questions of life.\" Dana was one of the founders of the Free-Soil party and a delegate from Boston to the Buffalo convention in 1848. He was also a delegate of the Massachusetts constitutional convention in 1853 and helped establish the Massachusetts Republican Party in 1855. Biographer John F. Lucid describes Dana's politics as, \"being labeled a conservative within the Free-Soil party, however, outside that party he was coming more and more to be regarded as a radical.\" In 1861, President Lincoln appointed Dana U.S.\u00a0Attorney for Massachusetts.\u00a0 In 1868, Dana's nomination by a faction of the Republican Party to run for the seat of the incumbent Ben Butler ended in disaster. Dana received only 10 percent of the vote and the lasting enmity of Butler. Eight years later, in 1876, Secretary of State Hamilton Fish appointed Dana to the post of Ambassador to Great Britain, but Butler and others succeeded in blocking Senate confirmation. Dana married Sarah Watson of Wethersfield, Connecticut\u00a0on August 25, 1841. They had six children, born in Boston and Cambridge, MA. In 1878 Dana gave his law practice to his son Richard Henry Dana III\u00a0as a wedding present upon Richard's marriage to Henry Wadsworth Longfellow's daughter Edith. Richard and\u00a0Sarah Dana\u00a0moved to Paris where they lived until the death of Richard's father\u00a0in 1879. After settling his father's estate, he and Sarah moved to Rome where they lived until his death in January of 1882.

                "bodyText": "Almost 70 years before Brown v. Board of Education, Mary Tape fought for her daughter\u2019s right to attend public school in California. Mary immigrated to the United States from China when she was eleven years old. In 1884, she tried to enroll her eight-year-old daughter Mamie at a white public school in San Francisco.[1] When school authorities turned Mamie away because of her Chinese ancestry, Mary and her husband Joseph sued the Board of Education. The lawsuit became a landmark civil rights case for public school desegregation.  How do you know if you are not welcome somewhere? How would you feel?  Immigration and Family Life Mary Tape was born in northern China near Shanghai in 1857. In 1868, at the age of eleven, she immigrated alone to the United States.\u00a0Within five months of her arrival, San Francisco\u2019s predominantly white Ladies\u2019 Protection and Relief Society took her in. Established in 1853, this Society pledged to \u201crender protection and relief to strangers, to sick and dependent women and children,\u201d by helping them to find jobs and temporary housing. Under their care, Mary learned English and American culture. She adopted the name Mary McGladery after of one of her caretakers.  In the early 1870s, Mary married Jeu Dip. After Jeu Dip immigrated in 1864, he adopted the name Joseph Tape. He got a job as a domestic servant for a white family and later delivered milk from their dairy farm. Joseph met Mary on one of his deliveries to the Ladies\u2019 Protection and Relief Society. Joseph eventually began his own delivery service for Chinese merchants from the docks to Chinatown. He later worked as a broker and interpreter for the Imperial Consulate of China. Mary and Joseph Tape quickly learned that assimilating to American culture had social and economic benefits. They distanced themselves from the community in Chinatown. The Tapes began a middle-class life together in Cow Hollow, San Francisco. They raised four children: Mamie, Frank, Emily, and Gertrude.\u00a0  As the Tapes settled into their new lives, however, anti-Chinese discrimination was intensifying in the United States. In 1882, Congress passed the Chinese Exclusion Act. The Act banned Chinese workers from immigrating to the United States. It also prevented them from becoming naturalized American citizens. These policies escalated the discrimination and exclusion Chinese immigrants faced. In California, Chinese immigrants endured racist stereotypes and even mob violence. They also faced legal restrictions on their civil rights to marry and testify against white Americans. Chinese Exclusion and School Segregation The anti-Chinese restrictions soon hit close to home for the Tape family. In 1884, Mary and Joseph tried to enroll their 8-year-old daughter Mamie at Spring Valley Primary School, an all-white school near their home. Although there were mission schools for Chinese children in San Francisco, those schools were farther away. The Tapes also knew that attending an all-white school would make it easier for their children to succeed.  Under a California state law passed in 1880, all children had the right to receive a public education. But members of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors did not want Chinese and Chinese American children to go to school with white children.\u00a0The Board maintained the racist belief that people of Chinese descent could not assimilate, which was one of the main arguments for Chinese exclusion. Yet\u00a0they also supported segregated schools because they feared that education would help Chinese and Chinese American children to assimilate. Exclusionists believed that assimilation was the first step toward establishing a permanent, growing Chinese American population in the United States, which would defeat the purpose of the exclusion policies.  Before Mamie could set foot in the classroom, she was turned away because of her Chinese ancestry.\u00a0Although she was born in the United States and was an American citizen, authorities at the school still viewed Mamie as a foreigner.  Anti-Chinese sentiment was common at the time. Many white Americans viewed Chinese immigrants as racially inferior and as competition for jobs. During the 1850s, California lawmakers and the courts singled out Chinese people as a separate race that was dangerous and untrustworthy. \u201cNegroes, Indians, and Mongolians\u201d were also excluded from public schools in California.\u00a0Although Black, Native, and Asian American students could eventually attend segregated schools, access to an education remained inconsistent for several decades.  Mary Tape challenged Mamie\u2019s exclusion from Spring Valley Primary School. She believed that it was wrong for her children to be segregated with other Chinese and Chinese American children because the Tapes were the \u201csame as other Caucasians, except in features.\u201d Mary argued that her family was just as American as their white neighbors, because they had assimilated to the standards of the white middle class. The Tape children spoke English, had American-style names, and wore American-style clothes. \u201cMy children don't dress like the other Chinese,\u201d Mary Tape asserted. \u201cThey look just as phunny amongst them as the Chinese dress in Chinese look amongst you Caucasians.\u201d Although the Tapes interpreted Chinese identity as cultural, the San Francisco Board of Education ultimately defined it by ancestry. Tape v. Hurley On Mamie\u2019s behalf, Joseph Tape sued the San Francisco Board of Education; Andrew Jackson Moulder, the public-school superintendent; and Jennie Hurley, the principal of Spring Valley Primary School. On January 9, 1885, the Superior Court of California ruled that excluding \u201cchildren of Chinese parents\u201d from public schools violated state law and the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Because Chinese Americans supported public schools with their taxes, Chinese American children were entitled to a public education. When the defendants appealed the case, the California Supreme Court upheld the original decision.  Educators and administrators in San Francisco remained determined to keep Mamie from going to school with white children. As soon as the decision came down, Superintendent Moulder telegrammed the California legislature. State lawmakers quickly passed a law that established \"separate schools for children of Mongolian or Chinese descent.\" The\u00a0Board claimed that these schools provided a way for Chinese American children to receive a public education, albeit one that was segregated from white students.  Mary Tape refused to accept this result and declared she would never send her children to the segregated school. In the local newspaper, the Daily Alta California, she published her dissent:  It seems no matter how a Chinese may live and dress so long as you know they Chinese. Then they are hated as one. There is not any right or justice for them.  After the Verdict Despite Mary Tape\u2019s resistance, the Tape children did attend the segregated school. On April 13, 1885, Mamie and her brother Frank became the first students at the new Chinese Primary School in Chinatown. After several years, the Tapes moved to a more diverse neighborhood near the western part of Chinatown. Although they wanted to distance themselves from other people of Chinese descent, the Tapes also wanted to increase their children\u2019s marriage prospects. They knew that interracial marriage was discouraged among both white and Chinese people.  Local newspapers had reported on Tape v. Hurley regularly and remained interested in the Tapes for years after the case. Although journalists only referred to Mamie as \u201cthat Chinese girl,\u201d the press made the Tape family well known. Mary Tape gained a reputation for her skills as a landscape painter and amateur photographer. She also impressed white journalists with her ability to use a telegraph to send Morse code messages to her husband when he was at work.  Mary Tape died in 1934. Although she was ultimately unsuccessful in getting her children into the white public school, Tape v. Hurley became a landmark case addressing segregation in public schools. In 1947, the federal circuit court case Mendez v. Westminster ruled that school segregation of non-white minority children violated the Equal Protection Clause. California governor Earl Warren subsequently signed a law ending school segregation in California. About 70 years after Tape v. Hurley, the 1954 U.S. Supreme Court case Brown v. Board of Education finally ruled that racial segregation in public schools was unconstitutional in the United States. Notes [1]\u00a0The city of San Francisco is a\u00a0Certified Local Government.

                "bodyText": "When Jane Addams penned Twenty Years at Hull House: With Autobiographical Notes, she presented her life story as inextricably tied to her work in running a settlement house. Addams was born into an affluent family in Illinois, but comfort and leisure did not suit her. After spending much of her early life searching for outlets for progressive work, Addams became a reformer. In 1889, this led her to found Hull House in Chicago, IL with a group of like-minded reformers.[1] From within the walls of a spacious, abandoned mansion, Addams and her colleagues created a sanctuary for immigrants who wanted to both settle and thrive in the city. Addams saw this work as a major part of her life story; another examination shows that this was but one important chapter.   Prior to creating Hull House, Addams completed her education at Rockford Female Seminary. The president of her class, Addams was a bright and ambitious woman born to a well-connected family. Her father, Illinois senator John Addams, left a sizeable inheritance that enabled her to pursue her education even further. After Rockford, Addams enrolled at the Women\u2019s Medical College of Philadelphia, PA, but personal health issues derailed her career in medicine. Searching for her purpose, Addams set out to find a different kind of education; she soon embarked on an extensive, long tour of Europe.  During her trip abroad, Addams became a critical observer of society. Deeply moved by the suffering of others, and especially the indigent, Addams sought solutions to the problems faced by residents of densely packed cities. Addams returned from this trip energized to create a settlement house similar to what she\u2019d seen in Toynbee Hall, a social settlement in London. From her base at Hull House, which she co-founded with her partner, Ellen Gates Starr, Addams became a highly influential progressive in Chicago.[2] In addition to providing direct social services for those who came through the settlement, Addams fought for better labor conditions, safe play spaces, cleaner city streets, a court system for juvenile offenders, and much more.   From the 1890s on, Addams became more involved with both progressive social issues and party politics. When Theodore Roosevelt ran for president in 1912, Addams offered her endorsement, seconding his nomination in Chicago during a convention of the Progressive Party. Addams had gained significant power and influence by this point through her advocacy work, yet she still could not vote. Addams continually campaigned for suffrage, both nationally and internationally, bemoaning that \u201cIt is always very difficult for me to make a speech on woman suffrage. I always feel that it belongs to the last century rather than this.\u201d[3] In 1913, the state of Illinois granted suffrage to women; the 19th Amendment was passed a few years later.   Addams was widely regarded as an important voice and conscience in this period known as the Progressive Era. Public opinion sharply changed when she fought against the entry of the United States in World War I. Throughout her life, an important tenant of Addams\u2019s politics was pacifism. Addams was involved in the meeting of the International Congress of Women in 1915 at The Hague and she became a leader in the Women\u2019s Peace Party and the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom. Addams\u2019s resistance to the war and accounting of worldwide suffering were seen by many, including agents within the Federal Bureau of Investigation, as unpatriotic.[4]   In 1931, just a few years before her death in May 1935, Addams was honored with a Nobel Peace Prize (shared with Nicholas Murray Butler). This came after a decade in which Addams was widely condemned for her pacifism. Addams may have found herself in Hull House, but the world was changed because she also used her voice so far outside of it, too.   A project through the\u00a0Save America's Treasures Grant Program, which helps preserve nationally significant historic properties and collections, funded work to preserve and cold store\u00a0master negatives of the Jane Addams Hull House Photograph Collection in 1999.  [1] Hull House, 800 S. Halsted, Chicago, Illinois was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on October 15, 1966 and designated a National Historic Landmark on June 23. 1965. The house and the dining room wing were documented by the Historic American Buildings Survey.  [2] Addams and Starr met in college. Addams later met, and set up house, with Mary Rozet Smith, who also worked with her at Hull House. They were together for over thirty years, reffering to each other as though they were married. Their relationship ended with Smith's death in 1934.  [3] Jane Addams, \u201cSpeech on Woman Suffrage,\u201d June 17, 1911.

While little is known about White\u2019s early life, by 1577 he was documenting, through illustrations, Inuit culture on Canada\u2019s Baffin Island.\u00a0 The importance of White\u2019s illustrations of the Algonquians as well as flora and fauna of the New World in 1585 cannot be overstated. His pictures of Carolina Algonquian life on the Outer Banks\u00a0portrayed neither the ruthless savage or the noble innocent- rather as members of a culture successfully adapting to an ever-changing environment. In addition, White\u2019s portraits of native wildlife provided Europeans with a glimpse of flora and fauna never before seen. Lastly, White\u2019s remarkably accurate maps of the Outer Banks formed the basis of European maps of the region for almost a century. John White\u2019s illustrations proved so influential to English exploration and colonization that his depictions were often used as all-encompassing examples of Native Americans; White\u2019s depiction of the Algonquian village of Pomeioc was used in an 18th-century text to describe Apache Indians of the American Southwest. In addition, contemporary maps of the 1607 Jamestown colony simply reworked White\u2019s imagery of the Outer Banks. After the failure of the Roanoke Colony (of which he became governor), little is known about John White. He died, possibly in Ireland, around 1606.\u00a0",

                "bodyText": "Quentin Roosevelt was born on November 19, 1897 and was the youngest child of Theodore and Edith Roosevelt. He was best known for his humor and charming personality.  Quentin was four years old when his father was sworn in as president and he took every advantage of living in the White House. Quentin and friends such as Charlie Taft (son of the Secretary of State and future President and Chief Justice of the Supreme Court William Howard Taft) and Roswell Pinckney (son of the White House Steward, Henry Pinckney) comprised the group of rambunctious youths that would\u00a0be known as the \u201cWhite House Gang.\u201d Together they carved a baseball diamond on the White House lawn without permission, defaced official presidential portraits in the White House with spitballs, and threw snowballs from the White House roof at unsuspecting Secret Service guards. One of his most memorable antics was to sneak his pony, Algonquin, up the White House elevator up to cheer up his sick brother, Archie.  Due to his playful actions, his father to nicknamed him \"Quinikins\u201d while his mother, Edith, labeled him a \"fine bad little boy.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0Quentin began his education at Force Elementary School in Washington, D.C. and then at the Groton School in Massachusetts. Quentin was an excellent student and was admitted to Harvard University in 1915. At age 19, while attending Harvard, Quentin met Flora Whitney and soon after the United States entered World War I, they became engaged but never married.  At the onset of World War I, inspired by the models of his father and older brothers, Quentin dropped out of Harvard and joined the United States Army Air Service where he eventually became a pursuit pilot. Quentin was killed in aerial combat over France on Bastille Day, July 14, 1918. As an honor to his father, Quentin was originally buried by German soldiers where his plane fell in Coulonges-Cohan, France. A few days later, American soldiers replaced the cross with their own and the French enclosed the area. In 1955, he was exhumed and later reburied with his oldest brother Theodore Roosevelt Jr., in Normandy, France.  As of 2020, he is the only child of a United States President to die in combat. In addition to be awarded the Purple Heart posthumously, Quentin was also granted a degree from Harvard in 1919, the year he would have graduated with his class.  Quentin is buried at the Normandy American Cemetery and Memorial in France.",

In all, seven Blair family members claimed public land in Sully County. Norvel broke ten acres in his first year on the land and cultivated ten additional acres each year before proving up.  Norvel and his sons also became known in the region for raising racehorses. One of their horses, Johnny Bee, held the record for the fastest horse in the state from 1907-1909. Norvel claimed that \u201cRacing horses is a fine sport for any man, as it teaches him how to be a good winner and good loser, and if you can\u2019t be both, you should never race horses.\u201d  Norvel and his family not only built a fortune for themselves, they also promoted Sully County to other African American settlers. They were successful in attracting other black families to the area. They engaged in multiple commercial enterprises, and also worked to establish and support local schools.

                "bodyText": "Born and raised in Richmond, Virginia, Armstead Walker came from a upper-middle class African-American family who ran a brick contracting business. After graduating high school he helped his brother run the family brick contracting business, worked as a postal worker and became husband to Maggie Lena Walker, President of St. Luke Penny Savings Bank.  Armstead Walker Jr. was born in December, 1860 in Richmond, Virginia. His family operated a brick contracting business in Richmond and was an upper-middle class family. He attended the segregated Richmond Public Schools, where he graduated from in 1875. He began working for his father's construction business in Richmond, learning the ins-and-outs of brick contracting on such buildings as the Leigh St. Armory while becoming well-connected with the upper class of Black Richmond.  During this time, Armstead would meet Maggie Mitchell, a teacher for Richmond Public Schools. After a courtship, they married on September 14th, 1886 at the First African Baptist Church. The Walker family grew when Maggie L. Walker gave birth three sons born between 1890 and 1897, though it was not without its hardship as their second son would pass away before his first birthday. Armstead would also have a distantly related niece, Margaret \"Polly\" Anderson come live with his family in the mid-1890s.\u00a0\u00a0  Armstead and his brother Andrew both continued running the family brick contracting business and Armstead also became a mail carrier in 1901, showing his connections in Richmond because mail carrier positions were given through the patronage system during this era. Armstead would also become a part of several organizations and social clubs throughout Richmond, such as the Richmond Athletic Social Club.\u00a0  On June 20th, 1915, Armstead Walker would be unexpectedly killed at the hands of his oldest son Russell. Mistaking him for a burglar, Russell used a pistol to fire through a screen on the back porch killing his father. Though he stood trial for murder, Russell was found not guilty but the consequences of his action and Armstead's death would still be felt for the Walker family and the Jackson Ward community.",

                "bodyText": "Russell E.T. Walker was the oldest son of Maggie Lena Walker and Armstead Walker Jr. He would follow in his mother's footsteps by working for the St. Luke Penny Savings Bank, Independent Order of St. Luke and other Black institutions throughout the country, but would tragically pass away at the age of 32 in 1923.  Russell Eccles Talmadge Walker was born in Richmond, Virginia on December 9th, 1890 to Maggie Lena Walker and Armstead Walker Jr. Growing up, Russell attended the segregated Richmond Public Schools finishing with Richmond Colored Normal School, the same school both of his parents graduated from. After graduating, he took additional accounting classes and would put his education to work by working for his mother's bank, the St. Luke Penny Savings Bank and her fraternal organization, the Independent Order of St. Luke. Russell would also marry Hattie Naomi Frazier, a family friend's daughter, in 1912 living together at the Walker family home at 110 1/2 E. Leigh Street.  Tragedy struck Russell and the Walker family in 1915 when he accidentally killed his father, Armstead Walker Jr., when he believed he was an intruder on their balcony porch. In the aftermath of the shooting, police arrested Russell and tried him for murder but after a stressful trial the jury declared Russell not guilty. The family would still feel the loss of Armstead, with Russell and Melvin without their father, and Maggie L. Walker without her husband of almost 30 years.  Joy would be brought into the Walker family by Russell and his wife Hattie N.F. Walker with the birth of their daughter, Maggie Laura Walker, on February 16th, 1918. Russell modernized the insurance tables to change the payments on a better cost-benefit analysis based on age and health, helping to increase the success of the Independent Order of St. Luke's insurance policies.  Russell left Richmond at the beginning of June 1918 to go to the Officer Training Camp at Fort Wayne in Detroit, Michigan. Russell never saw active combat however, as World War I ended before he deployed. Russell spent over a year away from Richmond working in New York City until July 1920, he accepted a job to work in the auditor's office at the Tuskegee Institute in Tuskegee Alabama. He spent only six months working there until he returned to Richmond to again work for the St. Luke Penny Savings Bank. He continued working for the St. Luke's on and off for the next few years while also spending time in New York and Philadelphia.\u00a0\u00a0Unfortunately, Russell's health took a turn for the worse in 1923 and he would pass away in Philadelphia on November 23, 1923 at the age of 32.  While Russell would pass away at a very young age, he would be honored for all of his work with the Independent Order of St. Luke during the 1925 Conference in New York. A eulogy was given in his honor at the event and members passed around a memorial card to sign for his family. Although he only spent a couple of years working for the IOSL and the St. Luke Penny Savings Bank, he stands as an example of how someone can leave a lasting impact in a short amount of time.   \u00a0",

                "bodyText": "As a soldier, reformer, and politician, Stephen Swails showed commitment to equality, placing him at the forefront of radical change in American race relations. Born in Columbia, Pennsylvania in 1823, Swails grew up in south central Pennsylvania and western New York. In the years before his birth, Swails\u2019 parents, freed persons from the slave state of Maryland, moved the family from the dangerous border state to Lancaster, Pennsylvania. Following the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850, abolitionists and slave catchers frequently fought over the area.1 To avoid additional risks, Swails and his family relocated to the abolitionist center of Elmira, New York. Swails worked as a waiter in Cooperstown, New York in April 1861 when the Civil War began.2 Swails shared the desire to serve in the war with other African American men who realized that it could radically change their status in the United States. However, the government prohibited their enlistment until the Lincoln administration issued the Emancipation Proclamation in 1863, which paved the way for Black men to serve in the military. Massachusetts soon began recruitment for the 54th Regiment, one of the first Black regiments of the Civil War, and enlisted the help of abolitionist leaders including Frederick Douglass to help fill its ranks. Douglass toured the Elmira area in the winter of 1863 as part of his recruitment tour. Likely inspired by Douglass\u2018s recruiting drives, Swails and hundreds of African Americans from New York and Pennsylvania enlisted in the new 54th Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry Regiment. They trained at Camp Meigs in the Boston area before heading to the warfront. Recognizing Swail\u2019s leadership ability, the regiment\u2019s young colonel, Robert Gould Shaw, quickly promoted him to 1st Sergeant. During the 54th's heroic assault on Fort Wagner, South Carolina, Swails cradled the body of K company commander as he died and rallied the retreating regiment. A defining moment for Swails came at Olustee, Florida on February 20, 1864. During the battle, he rallied the regiment and retreating Union forces, receiving a serious wound.3 While the 54th commanding officer recommended Swails for a promotion to 1st Lieutenant, racism within the military slowed the promotion for nearly a year. Despite emancipation and the disintegration of slavery, the basic idea that a Black man could lead White troops in battle struck at the heart of American racist attitudes. Captain Luis Emilio wrote, \u201cWhen the usual request was made, it was refused on account of Swails African descent, although to all appearances he was a white man.\u201d4 White officers in the regiment, such as Lt. Charles During, struggled to reconcile their own racism with the heroism of Black soldiers they witnessed on the battlefield and their belief that African Americans should not give orders to White soldiers.5 White officers gradually came to view their Black comrades with respect as they witnessed their bravery in battle. In January 1865, Swails finally received official promotion to officer rank. Though likely the only Black officer to receive this promotion, Swails never officially commanded in combat as the war soon ended without another major military engagement for the 54th.6 Reconstruction enabled Swails to rise to political prominence in post-war South Carolina. Elected to the state senate in 1868, he served continually for nearly 10 years. Swails became the most prominent member of the South Carolina senate, the president pro tempore, placing him in control of all bills that passed through the state legislature.7 Committed to universal education, he played a critical part in transforming The South Carolina College from a school for planter elite into the integrated University of South Carolina. Support for the Reconstruction governments faltered despite Swails\u2019s direct appeals to President Grant in 1872. Local militias violently overthrew the state\u2019s Reconstruction government in 1876, and the final federal troops withdrew the next year.\u00a0The restoration of the former Confederates to power ended Black political influence in the state. Some Black politicians, including Swails, continued to have local influence, however the leadership of the state targeted his reputation and his life. In 1878, he survived two assassination attempts, forcing him to limit time in the state.8 Despite continued threats, Swails returned to South Carolina in 1884 to run for Congress. Unable to campaign due to the danger, he lost the election. Swails died in Kingstree, South Carolina on May 17, 1900. His gravesite in the segregated Humane and Friendly Society Cemetery in Charleston remained unmarked until the 1970s. Lt. Swails\u2019s life spanned the dramatic change in American history from slavery to Black political power in the South. Although he died at the beginning of the long Jim Crow era, his life and accomplishments foreshadowed the continued fight for civil rights throughout the 20th and 21st centuries\u00a0that remains ongoing today.

                "bodyText": "Grace Lee Boggs was a Chinese American civil rights and labor activist. Her support for causes such as the Black Power movement, feminism, and the environment spanned over 70 years. Most of her activism was concentrated in Detroit, where she met her husband, James Boggs. Together, they became two of Detroit\u2019s best-known activists. Throughout her life, Grace Lee Boggs maintained the core belief that if people worked together, they could accomplish positive social change. What does it mean to be revolutionary? How about a \"solutionary\"? Early Life and Education Grace Lee Boggs\u2019s experiences as a Chinese American woman alerted her to the need for social change in the United States. Boggs was born above her father\u2019s restaurant in Providence, Rhode Island on June 27, 1915. Her parents were both immigrants from China.  Boggs became increasingly aware of racism after her family moved to New York City when she was 8. She grew up in Jackson Heights in Queens, New York. She and her family were the only Chinese people in the neighborhood. Boggs recalled feeling that she could not be Chinese and American at the same time. Nevertheless, her middle-class background afforded her opportunities. At 16 years old, Boggs began studying at Barnard College in Manhattan. She was one of only three students of color.[1] At the time, she felt unprepared and unclear about her path. In 1935, Boggs graduated with her bachelor\u2019s degree in philosophy. She went on to earn her PhD in philosophy from Bryn Mawr College in Pennsylvania.[2] Early Activism Employers refused to hire Boggs due to her gender and ethnicity. Years later, she remarked that \u201cEven department stores would say, \u2018We don't hire Orientals.\u2019\u201d She eventually got a job at the University of Chicago\u2019s philosophy library. Although she was no longer unemployed, Boggs earned only a $10 weekly stipend. Because her pay was so low, she could not afford rent. Instead, she lived in a rat-infested basement for free.  Boggs\u2019s involvement in revolutionary activism took off after she moved to Chicago. One day, she passed a group protesting inadequate living conditions among the poor, especially low-income African Americans. Those conditions closely resembled her own living situation. Boggs became involved with grassroots organizations that advocated for tenants\u2019 and workers\u2019 rights, such as the South Side Tenants Organization and socialist Workers Party. She later noted that this was the first time she connected with the African American community. \u201cI was aware that people were suffering, but it was more of a statistical thing,\u201d she explained. \u201cHere in Chicago, I was coming into contact with it as a human thing.\u201d\u00a0  Through her work, Boggs also became involved with the proposed 1941 March on Washington.\u00a0Organized by prominent African American labor unionist A. Philip Randolph, the march protested the segregation of the military and wartime manufacturing. Before the march could occur, President Franklin D. Roosevelt issued Executive Order 8802, which banned discrimination in the U.S. defense industry, so Randolph called off the march. The Executive Order was an important step toward full desegregation.\u00a0Becoming involved with the march and meeting Randolph helped Boggs realize what a movement could do.  Under the name \u201cRia Stone,\u201d Boggs became a central member of the Johnson-Forest Tendency, led by C. L. R. James and Raya Dunayevskaya. Named after its founders\u2019 pseudonyms,\u00a0the Johnson-Forest Tendency was a Marxist-Humanist subset of the Workers Party and later Socialist Workers Party. For twenty years, Boggs worked closely with James, a Trinidadian historian. Collaborating with James majorly influenced Boggs\u2019s social theory. Detroit Activism During the 1950s, Boggs moved to Detroit and began editing the radical newspaper Correspondence, which supported worker-centered revolution. While working for the paper, she met auto worker and activist James \u201cJimmy\u201d Boggs.\u00a0They married in 1953. Until she met her husband, Boggs felt that her knowledge of revolutionary struggle had mostly come from books and theory, instead of the streets. The couple threw themselves into supporting the local community. They quickly gained prominence for their writing and grassroots activism, which advocated for workers, the poor, the hungry, the unemployed, the elderly, and revolution to support those causes.  The Boggses also protested in support of the civil rights and Black Power movements. When Malcolm X visited Detroit, he stayed at their home.[3] Grace Lee Boggs even tried to convince him to run for the U.S. Senate in 1964. James and Grace Lee Boggs\u2019s home serves as the headquarters of the Boggs Center to Nurture Community Leadership, which supports activism and grassroots organizing on a local and national scale. Social Change, Revolutionaries, and \u2018Solutionaries\u2019 During her doctoral studies, Boggs became interested in the work of Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, Immanuel Kant, Karl Polanyi, and Karl Marx. Their theories of social change inspired her approach to rooting out societal inequity. Although her ideas initially focused on revolution, Boggs promoted personal transformation, reflection, and community organizing rather than violence. As Boggs continued in her activism, her views on rebellion and revolution evolved over time. In an interview, she explained:  \u201cWhat we tried to do is explain that a rebellion is righteous, because it\u2019s the protest by a people against injustice, but it\u2019s not enough. You have to go beyond rebellion. And it was a turning point in my life because until that time, I had not made a distinction between a rebellion and revolution. And it forced us to begin thinking, what does a revolution mean? How does it relate to evolution?\u201d  In 1992, Boggs co-founded Detroit Summer, a community-based youth empowerment and engagement program. When her husband James died the following year, Boggs become even more involved in Detroit activism. Reflecting on her life with James and her work with the Johnson-Forest Tendency, Boggs began to shift away from revolution and toward \u201csolutionaries.\u201d She drew inspiration from the everyday struggles of the oppressed. From their strategies for survival, Boggs learned to identify and develop solutions to make life livable. She realized change had not come from within the government or from putting pressure on the institutions of power. In her last book, The Next Revolution, she stressed: \u201cIt is a time of deep change, not just of social structure and economy but also of ourselves. If we want to see change in our lives, we have to change things ourselves.\u201d  Until she was 98, Boggs wrote a weekly column in the Michigan Citizen that promoted civic reforms. In 2013, Boggs established the James and Grace Lee Boggs School, a community-based charter school with a curriculum focused on Detroit. Months after her 100th birthday in June 2015, Boggs died on October 5, 2015.

While Hawkins did guide tours, many of his other tasks took him away from the cave;\u00a0odd jobs such as small repairs, chopping wood,\u00a0and plucking chickens.\u00a0African American\u00a0employees during the early 20th century had certain\u00a0restrictions\u00a0on\u00a0them.\u00a0All porter and waiter positions were filled by\u00a0black\u00a0employees, while white\u00a0staff\u00a0members\u00a0were\u00a0clerks and managers.\u00a0One account recalls that\u00a0Hawkins had to cancel his plans for a cave exploration trip because one of the managers needed him to peel potatoes. No doubt, his ability and familiarity with the cave would have been better served in exploration.  In 1907\u00a0Hawkins\u00a0co-discovered a\u00a0breathtaking\u00a0series of shafts known as Cathedral Domes with fellow guide\u00a0Will Bransford\u00a0and visitor, Benjamin Franklin\u00a0Einbigler. The avenue leading to this impressive series of domes was named Hawkins' Pass in his honor. Visitors are still able to view these\u00a0domes\u00a0on the Wild Cave Tour.  A unique trait of\u00a0Hawkins\u2019\u00a0was\u00a0how recognizable he is in photographs. He\u00a0often\u00a0secured his clothes with large blanket pins.\u00a0Oral history\u00a0says that his hands were so large he could clean a chicken of its feathers in just two swipes. With such large hands manipulating small buttons may have been too tedious a task.\u00a0  After more than half a decade at the Western State Hospital in Hopkinsville, Kentucky,\u00a0Hawkins\u00a0passed away in 1936 due to myocarditis and a contributing factor of senility. He resides today in an unmarked grave at the hospital cemetery.",

                "bodyText": "Louise was born Louisa Holmes on September 4, 1854, probably in Brooklyn, New York. She was the youngest daughter of Catherine Holmes Anthony (1824\u20131882) and Charles Lee Anthony (d. 1874), both of whom were born in Rhode Island. Louise had two sisters, Rosalie DeWolf (1844\u20131929), who married William Post, and Catherine \"Kate\" Lee (1845\u20131907), who married Henry Anthony Heiser. Her father was a socially prominent and wealthy dry-goods merchant in New York City under the firm name of Anthony & Hall. Among her extended family members were nieces Rose Post Howard, who married Thomas H. Howard (a descendant of Peter Stuyvesant), and Margaret Van Alen Brugui\u00e9re, who married James Laurens Van Alen (a grandson of William Backhouse Astor Jr. and Caroline Schermerhorn Astor). Louise first married Alfred Torrance (1852\u20131887), the son of Daniel Torrance and Sophia Johnson Vanderbilt Torrance. His sisters were Adelaide Torrance, who married Meredith Howland, and Marie Torrance, who married John A. Hadden Jr. Alfred was a grandson of Commodore Cornelius Vanderbilt, He was an equestrian of some reputation in London, Paris, and New York. Louise divorced Torrance in 1877. The following year on December 17, 1878, Louise married Torrance's cousin Frederick William Vanderbilt (1856\u20131938), son of William Henry Vanderbilt and Maria Louisa Kissam Vanderbilt. Apparently wed in secret, the marriage was the subject of some gossip. The New-York Daily Tribune reported her father-in-law's displeasure upon hearing of the secret marriage, noting they were \"debarred of the parental mansion and deprived of the parental blessing.\" This reaction may have been overstated. Frederick's father later bequeathed the couple his home located at 459 Fifth Avenue. Louise died at the Hotel Ritz in Paris on August 21, 1926. Frederick returned to the United States with Louise's body aboard the White Star Liner Homeric. A section of the baggage room on the lower deck was made into a chapel with wreaths, floral arrangements, and the spiral staircase leading to it draped in black cloth. She was interred in the Vanderbilt family mausoleum at Moravian Cemetery on Staten Island. During their marriage, which lasted nearly fifty years, Louise and Frederick made their New York City home at several locations. They also built Rough Point in Newport, Rhode Island, Pine Tree Point on Upper St. Regis Lake in the Adirondacks, and Hyde Park in Hyde Park, New York. In 1919, Louise purchased Sonogee at Bar Harbor, Maine. Those who knew her consistently note Louise\u2019s generosity. Friends and employees remembered her as generous and kind. Oral interviews recorded by the National Park Service document her local philanthropy in the village of Hyde Park. Louise provided educational opportunities and entertainments for the young men and women of the village. She established a reading room, attached to St. James' Chapel, sponsored lectures at the Town Hall, established a young man's clubroom in the village, and brought the Red Cross to Hyde Park in 1911. In 1917, she was largely responsible for establishing the District Health Nurse in Hyde Park. During World War I, she joined wealthy neighbors to equip, clothe, and arm a Hyde Park Home Defense Company of sixty-five men. Employees reported that Louise knew almost every family in Hyde Park and through her agents often helped families in need who were struggling with health or financial difficulties. She provided entertainments for village residents and their children, including ice cream festivals and, on at least one occasion, a steamer cruise on the Hudson River for all 700 residents of the village. She was known to distribute Christmas gifts to the children of Hyde Park. At Newport, she sponsored an annual Thanksgiving dinner for the newsboys and messenger boys from 1891 to 1925. Usually 350 to 400 boys attended the dinner, entering the hall to orchestra music. On occasion, Louise attended the dinner. At her Newport home Rough Point, she hosted a Lawn Fete for the benefit of the Newport Society for the Prevention and Control of Tuberculosis. Charities that benefited from her will at the time of her death included legacies in the sum of $10,000 each bequeathed to the New York Orthopedic Dispensary and Hospital, the Woman's Hospital, the Children's Aid Society, the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, the Stanton Street Helping Hand Association, and the New York Women's League for Animals, Inc. The largest single bequest was $300,000, to establish a trust fund for her Anthony Home, Inc., a model residential building for working women. Frederick inherited some of Louise's jewelry and Sonogee, her house at Bar Harbor, Maine. The bulk of her estate was bequeathed to her two nieces and her sister. Other friends and employees inherited bequests of various amounts. Her estate was estimated at more than $1,000,000.",

In 1905, Hatt went to the United States to live among the Cherokee in Oklahoma, which led him to study\u00a0ethnography at Harvard University from 1906-1907. He returned to Denmark to teach Native American Ethnology.\u00a0From 1919 to 1929, Hatt was an inspector at the Danish National Museum's Ethnography Department in Copenhagen. He participated in archeological research in Jutland.\u00a0From 1923, Hatt was a lecturer in cultural geography at the University of Copenhagen, becoming a full professor in 1929. In addition to memberships in European professional organizations for anthropologists, Hatt was a member of the American Ethnological Society and the American Anthropological Society.  From 1922 through 1923, working through the Danish National Museum, Hatt led an archeological survey of the Virgin Islands (including areas that are now national parks) and Santo Domingo in the Caribbean.\u00a0While Hatt visited several sites on both St. Thomas and St. John, he spent most of his time on St. Croix. Hatt conducted excavations at 14 sites on the island. He was one of the first archeologists to comment on the distribution of Amerindian sites across St. Croix and note the significance of their location regarding the local environment and the types of soil present.\u00a0  Island residents directed Hatt to Salt River, where he conducted extensive excavations at Salt River Point, today known as the Columbus Landing Site.\u00a0Hatt surveyed six blocks to be excavated, lettered A, B, C, E, F and G. Near the southwestern corner of Block A, he found a row of nine large stone slabs -- the first\u00a0batey\u00a0(ball court) discovered in the Virgin Islands. The row measured roughly 8 m long and 0.5 m high. Four slabs were carved in styles found throughout the Greater Antilles, resembling petroglyphs from lowland Amazonia, Surinam, the Guianas and the Orinoco basin. The carvings included the \u201cwrapped ancestor,\u201d the \u201cFrog Woman\u201d (the\u00a0cemi Attabeira), and several human faces. Based largely on work at Salt River, Hatt established the first prehistoric chronology for St. Croix and the Virgin Islands. Hatt's chronology has largely remained intact.\u00a0All of the artifacts, including the ballcourt stones, were taken to Denmark.",

                "bodyText": "Mary, commonly called Molly, Brant was born in 1736, most likely in the Ohio Valley. She grew up in Canajoharie and was educated in a European fashion, possibly at a mission school. In Mohawk she was also known as\u00a0\"Konwatsi'tsiaienni\" and \"Degonwadonti.\"  At age 18, she accompanied a delegation of Mohawk Chiefs to Philadelphia to discuss fraudulent land transactions. This was her first introduction into the world of political responsibility. She eventually became a Clan Mother.  She probably knew\u00a0Sir William Johnson\u00a0as an acquaintance during the 1740's and 1750's, but it was not until the 1759 that they became romantically linked. She bore him eight children, seven of which survived, and was officially referred to as William Johnson's \"housekeeper\" but was relied upon for much more.  Like\u00a0her brother Joseph, she assimilated both European and Indian culture into her life and was equally at home in both worlds. She spoke Mohawk and dressed in Mohawk fashion all her life and encouraged her children to do so. Her position as Clan Mother helped in Johnson's success as Indian Superintendent.  After Sir William's death in 1774, she moved her family from Johnson Hall back to Canajoharie and established a trading post. During the American Revolution she sheltered and fed loyalists and supplied them with arms and munitions. In 1777, it was Molly that sent word to\u00a0Sir John Johnson's and Joseph Brant's forces\u00a0that Herkimer was marching to rescue the\u00a0besieged Fort Schuyler. As a result of these actions she was forced to flee her home in the Mohawk Valley, leaving it behind to be plundered and occupied.  Her family fled to Fort Niagara and Molly began to direct her attention to keeping the\u00a0Six Nations\u00a0(particularly Mohawks) on the side of the British. Her position as a Clan Mother and her former relationship with Sir William Johnson meant that she exerted even more influence over them than her brother. A British was once recorded to have said: \"their uncommon good behaviour [was] in great measure to be ascribed to Miss Molly Brant's influence over them, which [was] far superior to that of all their Chiefs put together.\" She also used her position to promote the interests of her people while increasing her own power.  After the war, Molly settled at Kingston, Canada and received a substantial military pension for her wartime services. In 1785, on a trip to Schenectady, NY the Americans offered her financial compensation for her return. This was rejected \"with the utmost contempt.\" She remained staunchly pro-British and pro-Haudenosaunee the rest of her life.  Molly Brant died in 1796. The exact site of her burial remains unknown, but it is thought to be somewhere near Mohawk Church.",

During the years which homesteaders are required to make proof in support of their entries, Moses Singleton, his wife Priscilla Gray Singleton, and five children made improvements to the property. They cleared and fenced about fifteen acres for six seasons; constructed a log house and a cotton house.  On December 26, 1906, several of Moses\u2019 neighbors and longtime acquaintances agreed to serve as the witnesses to testify for his final proof for \u00a0his homestead entry claim (Geo J. Reiley, Steve Bell, John Turner, and William Williams). Steve Bell and John Turner completed the two witness testimonials.  The New Orleans Land Office published a notice on October 11, 1906, of the intention of Moses Singleton to make final proof of his homestead claim on October 10, 1900. The publication listed the claim for Homestead Entry #21930 for the northeast quarter of the southeast quarter, the south half of the southeast quarter, \u00a0and the \u00a0southeast quarter of the southwest quarter of Section twenty in Township three south of Range three east of the St. Helena Meridian, Louisiana. \u00a0  Moses completed the Final Affidavit Required of Homestead Claimants at the New Orleans, Louisiana Land Office on December 26, 1906. \u00a0The New Orleans Land Office under the leadership of Land Register Walter L. Cohen issued the Final Land Certificate #13009 on August 14, 1907. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  Moses resided on this property until the time of his death.

                "bodyText": "Edith Kermit Carow Roosevelt was Theodore Roosevelt's second wife and served as First Lady during his presidency from 1901-1909. She was step-mother to Alice Roosevelt Longworth, and mother to Theodore Roosevelt, Jr., Kermit Roosevelt, Ethel Roosevelt Derby, Archibald Roosevelt, and Quentin Roosevelt.  Edith Kermit Carow Roosevelt was born August 6, 1861 in New York City to Charles Carow and Gertrude Tyler. Although originally born into wealth, the family fell on hard times. The Carows then moved into Edith\u2019s mother\u2019s aunt\u2019s home in New York City, where Edith quickly became friends with neighbors Corinne Roosevelt, who was her age, and Corinne\u2019s older brother Theodore. Corinne and Theodore\u2019s mother, Mittie Roosevelt, enjoyed Edith, and invited her to be tutored alongside her children in their early years. Growing up, Edith became an extended member of the Roosevelt family, often being invited along for family vacations out in Oyster Bay. Many in the Roosevelt family believed that when Edith was old enough to marry, she and Theodore would become a couple, as the pair would often write letters to one another when apart and had a close friendship.\u00a0  At the age of eighteen, Theodore moved to Boston to attend Harvard University. It was during this time that Edith and he experienced a falling out and no longer corresponded. Around that same time, Theodore met Alice Lee who he would marry in 1880. Alice would die from complications due to childbirth and soon after, a heartbroken Theodore retreated to his ranch in the Dakota Territory. Upon his return to New York, Theodore rekindled his relationship with Edith after a serendipitous meeting at his sister Anna\u2019s home. Edith and Theodore would eventually marry on December 2, 1886. While they spent much of their early marriage apart, Edith in Europe and Theodore embarking on his political career, both corresponded often.  Edith and Theodore moved into their home in Oyster Bay in 1886, which they named Sagamore Hill and kept it as their permanent residence throughout their entire lives. Edith was fully in charge of running the household affairs, which included managing finances and creating menus, while simultaneously raising six rambunctious children: Ted Jr., Kermit, Ethel, Archibald, and Quentin, along with her stepdaughter Alice. From Ted Jr.\u2019s birth in 1887 to Quentin\u2019s birth in 1897, Theodore held various public offices and was often apart from the family, leaving Edith and the children to continue on in their activities at Sagamore Hill. Edith was an avid reader and loved to take a book or two out to a rose arbor she had built near her home, whenever she needed a quick break from her many responsibilities.  During her tenure as First Lady of the United States, Edith expanded the West Wing of the White House and updated much of the furniture, which she financed using part of her husband\u2019s salary. From 1901-1909, she continued to manage the family affairs so Theodore could fully focus on the presidency. While remaining uninvolved publicly in political matters, she was an important advisor to her husband. She was known for having an excellent judge of character, and Theodore claimed that \u201cwhenever I go against her judgement, I regret it.\u201d Edith Roosevelt was a positive force in Washington D.C., where statesmen, foreign dignitaries, socialites, and politicians of both parties greatly enjoyed the company of the First Lady.  When Theodore and Edith returned home to Oyster Bay after the presidency, the family had expanded. New sons- and daughters in-law, and grandchildren would dominate Edith and Theodore\u2019s life for the next ten years. Both Edith and Theodore delighted in their grandchildren, who would visit or stay with them often at Sagamore Hill, but they continued to travel, write, and entertain. Edith resumed her role of president of the household, while Theodore remained as adventurous as ever.  Theodore died on January 6, 1919 at Sagamore Hill. While it was difficult for Edith, she continued her lifelong passions of reading and traveling. With the help of her family she published books and wrote for a political journal. Towards the end of her life, Edith continued to support various philanthropic organizations (including financially supporting some Rough Riders who had fallen on hard times) and would frequently visit her family\u2019s ancestral home, Mortlake Manor, in Brooklyn, Connecticut, which she had purchased in 1927.  Between 1909 and 1948, Edith traveled to over thirty countries including trips to Italy to visit her sister, Emily, a train journey across Asia with her son Kermit and his wife Belle, and a stay in Puerto Rico with her son Theodore Jr. who was serving as governor there. During this time, Edith co-wrote \u201cCleared for Strange Ports,\u201d a book that was an account of her travels as well as reflections on motherhood and the legacy she hoped to leave behind. She also researched and wrote a genealogy of her mother\u2019s family, the Tyler\u2019s, titled \u201cAmerican Backlogs: The Story of Gertrude Tyler and Her Family.\u201d  Edith Roosevelt had an air of confidence and strength, but was also kind, gracious, and welcoming. She saw that her husband followed his career and that her children grew up to be successful. When Edith was nearing the last years of her life, she wanted to be remembered by one line. The line she had engraved on her tombstone; \u201cEverything she did was for the happiness of others.\u201d  After a long and full life Edith died at the age of 87 on September 30, 1948 at Sagamore Hill. She is buried next to Theodore at Youngs Memorial Cemetery in Oyster Bay, NY.",

                "bodyText": "Oscar\u00a0Micheaux\u00a0was an\u00a0African-American\u00a0homesteader. Like many Black homesteaders, his parents Calvin and Belle Michaux were born enslaved, in Kentucky. They moved across the Ohio River to Illinois, where Oscar was born in 1884. His family grew wheat and corn on their 80-acre farm.  As a young man,\u00a0Micheaux\u00a0worked odd jobs in and around Chicago, including as a Pullman porter. As he traveled the nation on a Pullman, he decided to homestead \u2013 the prairie called to him.  Black homesteaders understood better than anyone the implications of landownership\u00a0on\u00a0political and social freedoms and rights. The Emancipation Proclamation, which like the Homestead Act was signed into law by President Abraham Lincoln, declared \u201cthat all persons held as slaves\u2026. Are, and henceforward shall be free.\u201d\u00a0After Emancipation Blacks sought to build new lives, provide for their families,\u00a0and\u00a0educate their children. They especially sought to own their own\u00a0land, and\u00a0realize their long denied dreams of working their own farm. They knew how to\u00a0farm, and\u00a0saw land\u00a0ownership\u00a0as their way to support themselves and their families, and a symbol of\u00a0their freedom and equality in the United States.  Oscar\u00a0Micheaux\u00a0traveled to South Dakota in 1904 to participate in a lottery run by the General Land Office to distribute homesteading lands on the Rosebud Reservation. However, with more than 100,000 claimants for only 2,400 homesteads, he was not able to obtain one directly in the lottery drawing. He hired a land locator for $80 and purchased a relinquished homestead.\u00a0After some success as a homesteader on the Rosebud Indian Reservation, a three year drought destroyed his crops.  Oscar was in his field rain or shine, yielding only to frozen ground, plowing up 120 acres in his first year. His determination soon turned his neighbors laughter to a \u201cgrudging respect, then to acceptance, and finally to admiration, when they realized that he had broken many more acres of prairie than most of them.\u201d This admiration left Oscar feeling tentatively welcome in an area where he was the lone African American.\u00a0Knowing the delicate nature of race relations, Oscar knew a romantic relationship with a white woman would not be tolerated, even though Oscar had strong feelings for a local white woman and those feelings appear to have been reciprocated.  Micheaux married Orlean McCracken,\u00a0a schoolteacher and daughter of a reverend from Chicago, in 1910 and they had\u00a0a fraught marriage. When Oscar\u00a0traveled for work, Orlean felt abandoned.\u00a0During one of the times he was away, Orlean suffered a miscarriage. Her family did not like having her on the homestead alone, so they traveled to South Dakota and took her back to Chicago with them.\u00a0Orlean's father sold some of Micheaux's property and took the money. Micheaux tried unsuccessfully to get Orlean and his property back. They divorced in 1917.  Oscar began writing down his experiences as a homesteader as a way to cope with the hardships he was enduring. His writings were a mix of fiction and biography meant to tell his story of struggle with, and conquest of, the land. He soon had created a full length book that he appropriately titled\u00a0The Conquest. He began traveling throughout the region selling the book to his friends and neighbors. This new enterprise soon led to a second novel titled\u00a0The Homesteader. His self published novels were moderately successful, but more importantly they caught the attention of a production company that wanted to turn them into a movie.\u00a0  In 1919, he adapted his story into a film, becoming the first known\u00a0African-American\u00a0filmmaker and director. Though\u00a0The Homesteader\u00a0(1919) is considered to be a \u201clost film\u201d, it launched\u00a0Micheaux\u2019s\u00a0career.\u00a0  Over 30 years he made more than 40 films, and his work has been preserved by the Library of Congress and the National Film Registry as \u201cculturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.\u201d\u00a0Micheaux\u2019s\u00a0films featured contemporary\u00a0African-American\u00a0life. His works highlighted and worked to combat racism and racial inequality. Black actors in Micheaux's films played the roles of doctors, businessman, detectives, and lawyers. His movies provided a window into black life and the African American perspective on race.  Oscar Micheaux remarried in 1926\u00a0to actress Alice B. Russell. She appeared in six of his films. Oscar passed away of heart failure on March 25, 1951 at the age of 67, in Charlotte, North Carolina on a business trip. Oscar was buried in Great Bend, Kansas.\u00a0His grave stone reads \u201cA Man Ahead of his Time.\u201d  Links:\u00a0 Oscar\u00a0Micheaux\u00a0Archival Collection at the New York Public Library\u00a0archives.nypl.org -- Oscar\u00a0Micheaux\u00a0papers\u00a0 Oscar Micheaux\u00a0Patent Details - BLM GLO Records\u00a0  Millions of people, millions of stories shared here!",

                "bodyText": "William \u201cWill\u201d Garvin was born into slavery in southcentral Kentucky in 1847 or 1848, his last name came from his and his parents\u2019 enslaver, Sinclair Garvin. Many other records of Garvins in the area have been found, both African American and European American, any relationships with Will remain unknown.\u00a0  On February 25, 1865, Will Garvin enlisted with Company M, 12th Heavy Artillery, U.S. Colored Troops at Bowling Green, Kentucky. While the Emancipation Proclamation gave freedom to enslaved people in confederate states in 1863, as a border state Kentucky was not covered in this proclamation. Often, the clearest path to freedom for enslaved Kentuckians in the years leading up to the 13th amendment was to enlist with the Union army. It remains unknown whether or not Will had permission from his enslaver when he enlisted in 1865.\u00a0  After the Civil War, Will settled in Edmonson County, Kentucky where he was one of only six black Civil War veterans, and soon began guiding tours at Mammoth Cave. He married Hannah Bransford, the daughter of formerly enslaved guide Nick Bransford, on May 27, 1876.\u00a0  Will Garvin is most widely known in Mammoth Cave history for discovering an area known as the Corkscrew. This maze through collapsed rubble linked the upper levels of the cave system to the lower levels near the underground rivers. It provided an exit for the cave where the visitor would have to do very little retracing of steps. Additionally, Will is the first person known to have experienced the optical illusion known as the Statue of Martha Washington. As he was exiting the cave he saw the spectral silhouette of a woman appear down the passage. Upon further examination it was merely the reflection of light from an approaching tour casting light upon the bends of the cave avenue. On occasion the Statue of Martha Washington can be seen on certain tours of the Historic section.\u00a0  Some have given Will Garvin credit for the discovery of Colossal Caverns. This cave was operated by the L&N Railroad and opened to the public. In 1972 this system was found to connect to the Mammoth Cave system. Today Colossal Caverns is one of hundreds of caves protected within Mammoth Cave National Park.\u00a0  On May 24, 1906, just three days before his 30th wedding anniversary, Will Garvin passed away. The exact place of his burial is unknown, the most likely locations are Will and Hannah\u2019s former homestead or the cemetery of Pleasant Union Baptist Church, both of which stood on Flint Ridge. Will\u2019s gravestone is one of many that has been lost to time inside the boundaries of Mammoth Cave National Park.\u00a0",

                "bodyText": "Sue Ko Lee was a Chinese American garment worker and labor organizer with the Chinese Ladies\u2019 Garment Workers\u2019 Association. In 1938, she participated in a successful fifteen-week strike against the National Dollar Stores garment factory.\u00a0At the time, it was the longest strike in the history of San Francisco\u2019s Chinatown. Lee went on to become a leader in the International Ladies\u2019 Garment Workers\u2019 Union (ILGWU) in California.   When have you experienced a turning point in your life? How did it change things?   Sue Ko Lee was born in Honolulu, Hawaii in 1910. She grew up the oldest of ten children in Watsonville, California. When she was eighteen, she married Lee Jew Hing, an immigrant from China who worked as a bookkeeper for National Dollar Stores. Lee took a job at the same factory, along with several of her family members. Chinese Americans and the Labor Movement Most Chinese workers in San Francisco worked for Chinese employers like Joe Shoong, the owner of National Dollar Stores.[1] They often made low wages and worked in poor conditions, but their options were limited. Most white-owned businesses refused to hire them. In addition, because the Chinese immigrant community was so close-knit, many workers were connected to their bosses through family and friendship ties. Such personal relationships sometimes made workers reluctant to speak out against poor treatment.  Chinese workers like Lee had a complicated relationship with the labor movement. Many unions had supported the Page Act (1875) and the Chinese Exclusion Act (1882)\u00a0which restricted immigration from China. They had argued that Chinese laborers would undermine white workers\u2019 union gains by accepting lower wages and poor treatment. They often used racist imagery in lobbying for the laws. This tension persisted into the 1900s. Chinese and Chinese American workers were locked out of unionized factories by racist hiring practices. They reasonably feared that their jobs would be taken by white workers if all the factories were unionized.  But by the 1930s, unions like the ILGWU were working hard to organize Black, Latino, and Asian American workers. New Deal laws had established a minimum wage and legal protections for unionizing. Empowered unions wanted to expand their ranks. In San Francisco, the ILGWU was concerned that Chinese-owned factories undercut white-owned union shops by charging lower prices for work. They did this by paying lower wages and assigning their workers longer hours. These practices allowed them stay in business in the face of the hardship of the Great Depression\u2014but came at a high cost to their workers. The Dollar Store Strike As Sue Ko Lee recalled it, ILGWU organizers struggled to make any headway among Chinese workers until an organizer named Jennie Matyas arrived. Matyas, herself an immigrant from Hungary, worked hard to gain the trust of the workers and their Chinese community. She built personal relationships and made the case for unionization in local outlets like the Chinese Digest.  In 1938, Sue Ko Lee and her coworkers voted to join the ILGWU, using ballots written in both English and Chinese.\u00a0They became the Chinese Ladies\u2019 Garment Workers\u2019 Union, Local 341.  Below: Sue Ko Lee and her coworkers, 1940s. Lee is second from right. (Judy Yung Collection. Labor Archives and Research Center, San Francisco State University.)    After several bilingual collective bargaining sessions, the union and National Dollar Stores signed a preliminary agreement. But then the factory arranged a \u201csale\u201d to a group of its managers, which the workers saw as an attempt to get out of the contract. In response, they decided it was time to go on strike. More than 150 of them walked out. Both American-born Chinese workers and Chinese immigrants, many of them older women, joined the strike. With the ILGWU\u2019s help, Sue Ko Lee and other strike leaders organized picket lines and breakfasts of donuts and coffee for the strikers.  After more than three months on the picket lines, the strikers prevailed, winning a new contract and a guaranteed pay rate. Unfortunately, the factory closed the following year. While the ILGWU\u2019s progress in organizing Chinese workers remained slow, Jennie Matyas was able to help some of the union members, including Lee, get jobs in white-owned factories where they could make more money. In the 1950s, Lee joined the ILGWU as a staff member in Local 101 and attended national conventions.  Later in her life, Lee reflected on the importance of the strike in her own story:  \u201cIn my opinion, the strike was the best thing that ever happened. It changed our lives. We overcame bigotry, didn\u2019t we? \u2026 I know it was a turning point in my life.\u201d  Sue Ko Lee and Lee Jew Hing had two children together, Mervyn and Stanley. Lee preserved items and documents about the strike in a scrapbook, and told the historian Judy Yung about her memories of the strike in an oral history interview. Her memories and saved materials provide much of what we know about the events of the strike. Lee died in 1996 at the age of 86. \u00a0 Notes [1] The city of San Francisco, where the National Dollar Stores factory was located, is a Certified Local Government.

                "bodyText": "\"I'll go and do more.\" - Annie Dodge Wauneka  Annie Dodge was born into the Tse ni\u0301jiki\u0301ni\u0301 (Cliff Dwelling People) Clan of the Din\u00e9 (Navajo) Tribe in a traditional hogan in 1910. She was just a child when Spanish Influenza began claiming\u00a0the lives of millions of people around the world. It was difficult to\u00a0accurately keep up with the losses at the time, but today the\u00a0CDC estimates\u00a0the total number of lives taken by the virus at 50 million. Fear and panic consumed people\u00a0around the world, and eventually the Spanish Influenza\u00a0came to Annie's community. At 8 years old, after surviving the flu herself, Annie\u00a0stepped up to help medical workers care for victims and discovered a passion for medicine\u00a0and helping people. After school and marriage (to George Wauneka), she\u00a0went on to study public health and became an activist for the health and welfare of the Navajo Nation. In 1951, Annie\u00a0was one of the first women ever elected to the Tribal Council and began to put her knowledge to use. She created an English-Navajo medical dictionary to help doctors and patients communicate, educated people about tuberculosis, gave regular radio broadcasts in Navajo to share health and welfare information, served on advisory boards to the U.S. Surgeon General and the U.S. Public Health Service, and improved housing and sanitation conditions in her community. She dedicated her life to helping her people access the advantages of modern medicine without sacrificing traditional cultural values. Annie Dodge Wauneka received the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1963 for her life of service. Albert A. Hale, the president of the Navajo Nation, called her \"our legendary mother\" and \"the most honored Navajo in our history.\"  Learn more about Annie Dodge Wauneka",

She attended public schools in Michigan\u2019s Upper Peninsula before attending the Haskell Institute in Lawrence, Kansas where she received her teacher\u2019s diploma.[1] After graduating, she returned to Michigan, and taught school at the Zeba Mission in the Upper Peninsula for many years.[2] In 1903, she married Charles Anderson and the couple ran a hotel in L\u2019Anse, Michigan, county seat of Baraga County.  Throughout her adult life, she was interested in improving the lives of those less fortunate, and had particular interest in public health. Before 1925, she organized the first public health service in Baraga County, bringing the first public health nurse to the region.  In 1925, Anderson ran for the Michigan House of Representatives, and won.[3] She was the first woman elected to the Michigan House of Representatives and the first Native American woman to serve in a state legislature. She represented Baraga, Iron, Keweenaw, and Ontonagon Counties. She served one term from 1925 to 1926, losing her seat to a redistricting. \u00a0While in office, Anderson was appointed the chair of the committee overseeing the Industrial Home for Girls, and sat on the committees for Agriculture, Insurance, and the Northern State Normal School (now Northern Michigan University). She continued promoting public health, fighting against alcoholism and tuberculosis. She also championed the fight to recognize Native American fishing rights on Huron Bay.  After her government service, she became active with the Michigan Grange, serving as the representative for the Upper Peninsula.  In recognizing her contributions in 2001, the Michigan Women\u2019s Hall of Fame wrote, \u201cAt a time when minorities, including Native Americans, were subjected to considerable economic and social discrimination, Anderson\u2019s determination to attend college and return the benefits of her education to her community was notable. Her role as educator, legislator, and public health reform leader aided the Native American community as well as the whole of society.\u201d  She died in 1950. Her burial location is unknown.

                "bodyText": "Dr. Alice Hamilton saved countless workers\u2019 lives as a pioneer in industrial health and safety. Beginning in the 1890s, she treated working-class immigrant patients at Hull House in Chicago.[1] She learned about how diseases, toxic chemicals, and workplace injuries hurt poorer people the most. Dr. Hamilton fought to end these disparities. She investigated companies' safety records and pushed for stronger worker protections. She also promoted the peace movement and women\u2019s rights. In 1919, Dr. Hamilton became the first woman on the faculty at Harvard University.\u00a0\u00a0 Alice Hamilton was born in 1869 and grew up in Fort Wayne, Indiana. She studied medicine at the University of Michigan, graduating in 1893. She completed further training in bacteriology (the study of bacteria) and pathology (the study of diseases).\u00a0 In 1897, Dr. Hamilton took a job at Northwestern University. She also joined Hull House, the settlement house on Chicago\u2019s West Side. Founded by social reformers\u00a0Jane Addams\u00a0and Ellen Gates Starr, Hull House was the most famous of the American \u201csettlement houses.\u201d Progressive reformers set up these institutions in poor urban areas. Middle-class settlement workers and their low-income neighbors lived and worked closely together. Reformers hoped they would not only solve pressing social problems, but also forge bonds across social classes.\u00a0 Hull House served communities of working-class immigrants. Many of them endured dangerous and toxic conditions at their jobs and in their homes. Diseases like typhus and typhoid fever spread quickly in crowded tenements. Poorer neighborhoods lacked adequate sanitation services from the city. Governments did not require businesses to protect employee health and safety. Workers died in industrial accidents caused by heavy machinery and dangerous conditions. Some factories released poisonous chemicals like lead and mercury.\u00a0 At Hull House, Dr. Hamilton saw this toll up close. Galvanized, she started publishing studies on what was then called \u201cindustrial medicine.\u201d In 1908, the state of Illinois appointed her to its new Occupational Diseases Commission. This was the first government body to investigate employee health and safety. Dr. Hamilton conducted a study of industrial toxins that led to the passage of an influential worker protection law in Illinois. She went on to work for the Labor Department conducting similar studies in other states. Alongside Jane Addams, Dr. Hamilton also continued to work for women's rights, including suffrage, and the international peace movement.\u00a0 In 1919, Harvard hired Dr. Hamilton to join its new Department of Industrial Medicine. She became the first woman on the faculty there. The university had not planned on breaking this glass ceiling. But industrial medicine was a female-dominated field. Many male doctors saw it as linked to reform causes associated with women, and avoided it. \"I was really about the only candidate available,\" Hamilton wrote later.\u00a0\u00a0 Dr. Alice Hamilton laid the foundation for health and safety protections we take for granted today. A drive to protect vulnerable people and hold industry accountable fueled her work as a public health pioneer.\u00a0 Notes [1] Hull House was designated a U.S. National Historic Landmark on June 23, 1965. It is currently a museum. More information about the site is available at\u00a0https://www.hullhousemuseum.org.

                "bodyText": "Dr. Elizabeth Blackwell was the first woman in the United States to earn a medical degree. She became a lifelong advocate for female doctors.  Born in Bristol, England in 1821, Blackwell moved with her family to the United States at the age of 11. Her father Samuel made sure his daughters got a good education. When Samuel died in 1838, several of the Blackwell women became schoolteachers to provide for the family. Teaching was one of the only careers open to white, middle-class women during most of the 1800s.  After the family\u2019s finances stabilized, Elizabeth looked for a more interesting line of work. Though she had felt \u201cdisgust\u201d at the study of the body and physiology as a younger student, the experience of a sick female friend eventually changed her mind. Before she died, this friend told Elizabeth that if a \u201clady doctor\u201d had cared for her, she would have suffered less. She encouraged Elizabeth to use her brains and energy to become a physician.  Blackwell wrote to several doctors she knew for advice on how to proceed. They all told her it would be impossible. Even if she could get admitted to a medical school, there was no way she would be able to graduate and practice. A few even advised her to disguise herself as a man. But the discouragement only made her more determined to succeed. \u201cThe idea of winning a doctor\u2019s degree gradually assumed the aspect of a great moral struggle, and the moral fight possessed immense attraction for me,\u201d she wrote. She saved her money from teaching and set out to win the fight.  Blackwell applied to more than a dozen medical schools. She received several rejections before finally, in October 1847, an acceptance letter arrived from Geneva Medical College in upstate New York. Although the male students mostly accepted her, she had to fight for access to a complete education. At first, she was excluded from observing surgical demonstrations. She had to insist that she be considered \u201ca student simply,\u201d not treated differently because of her sex.  Dr. Blackwell graduated in 1849 to great public interest and approval. In need of further training that was still not available in the United States, she studied for a few years in England and France. Unfortunately, her goal of becoming a surgeon was thwarted when she contracted an infection that caused her to lose her left eye.  In the early 1850s, Dr. Blackwell returned to the United States. She and two other female doctors\u2014Dr. Marie Zakrzewska and Blackwell\u2019s younger sister Dr. Emily Blackwell\u2014established the New York Infirmary for Indigent Women and Children (now New York-Presbyterian Lower Manhattan Hospital).[1] They treated poor patients and provided medical training for women.  In her later years, Blackwell wrote several books on medicine and an autobiography. She continued to advocate for women in medicine until old age and poor health limited her activities. She died in England in 1910. Notes [1] Dr. Blackwell's former home and medical practice was located in the building that still stands at 80 University Place, part of the Greenwich Village Historic District.

                "bodyText": "Dr. Rebecca Lee Crumpler was the first Black woman to earn a medical degree in the United States. A true pioneer, she battled deep-seated prejudice against women and African Americans in medicine. After earning her degree in Boston, she spent time in Richmond, Virginia after the Civil War, caring for formerly enslaved people. In 1883, Dr. Crumpler published her\u00a0Book of Medical Discourses. It chronicles her experiences as a doctor and provides guidance on maternal and child health.\u00a0\u00a0 Born Rebecca Davis in Delaware in 1831, Crumpler was raised by an aunt in Pennsylvania who often helped care for sick neighbors. Those early experiences made her want to work to \u201crelieve the suffering of others.\u201d In the early 1850s she moved to Massachusetts and became a nurse.\u00a0\u00a0 Crumpler earned a place at the New England Female Medical College\u00a0(NEFMC)\u00a0in 1860. The school was the first in the country to train women M.D.s. At the time, many men argued that women were too delicate or not intelligent enough to be doctors. Most medical schools barred Black students regardless of gender.\u00a0 The NEFMC initially trained women to work only as midwives. This focus reflected its founder Samuel Gregory\u2019s belief that it was improper for male doctors to assist with childbirth. But by the time Crumpler attended, the curriculum had expanded to encompass a more complete medical education.\u00a0\u00a0 Dr. Crumpler graduated from New England Female Medical College in 1864, becoming the first female African American doctor. Her official degree was \u201cDoctress of Medicine.\u201d She began practicing in Boston, but at the end of the Civil War found herself drawn to Richmond, Virginia as a \u201cproper field for real missionary work.\u201d She collaborated with the\u00a0Freedmen\u2019s Bureau\u00a0and other charity and missionary groups to care for freed African Americans. Many of her patients were very poor people who would otherwise have had no access to medical care. The enormous needs of these patients, and the discrimination they faced from many white doctors, encouraged an increasing number of African Americans to seek medical training.\u00a0 Dr. Crumpler continued to practice after returning to Boston in the late 1860s. She treated patients in and around her home on Joy Street in Beacon Hill, at the time a mainly Black neighborhood, and regardless of whether they could pay.1\u00a0Later she and her\u00a0second\u00a0husband moved to the Hyde Park neighborhood of Boston. In 1883, she published\u00a0A Book of Medical Discourses. It features advice on treating illnesses in infants and young children and women of childbearing age.\u00a0\u00a0 Dr. Crumpler married twice and had one child, Lizzie Sinclair Crumpler. She passed away in Boston in 1895 and is buried in Fairview Cemetery.2\u00a0Her life and work testify to her talent and determination to help other people, in the face of doubled prejudice against her gender and race.\u00a0 Footnotes  Crumpler's home in Beacon Hill is featured on\u00a0the Boston Black Heritage Trail, part of the\u00a0Boston African American National Historic Site. Fairview Cemetery was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on September 16, 2009.

                "bodyText": "Dr. Virginia M. Alexander was a pioneering Black doctor and public health expert. She treated Black patients and studied racism in the healthcare system. Through her work, Dr. Alexander showed how segregation and racism harmed Black Americans' health.  Virginia Alexander was born in 1899 in South Philadelphia. Both her parents had been born enslaved. The family encountered financial difficulty when Virginia was young. Her mother died, and her father\u2019s livery stable business failed as cars replaced horses on city streets. Education and Training Virginia\u2019s father Hilliard insisted that his children finish their education. Virginia graduated from William Penn High School for Girls in 1917.[1] She and her brother Raymond won scholarships to the University of Pennsylvania.[2] To pay for her living expenses, Alexander worked waiting tables and cleaning houses. She graduated in 1920 and started medical school at the Woman\u2019s Medical College of Pennsylvania (WMCP).  The WMCP accepted students from a wide variety of backgrounds. But Alexander faced racism as one of the only Black students there. After graduation, no Philadelphia hospital would offer her an internship because of her race. Even the hospital run by her medical school refused to accept Black doctors. Alexander finally found a position at the Kansas City Colored Hospital. She and a colleague became the first women interns there.  Dr. Alexander returned to Philadelphia after her internship and residency. She began treating patients out of her home. In 1930, she expanded her house to make room for a three-bed hospital she named the Aspiranto Health Home. She treated Black patients who experienced racism from white staff in Philadelphia hospitals. Dr. Alexander described Aspiranto as an example of \u201csocialized\u201d medicine. She treated many patients free of charge. Public Health Research In 1935, Dr. Alexander conducted a study on race and public health in North Philadelphia. She found shocking disparities in health outcomes among Black and white residents. The number of Black babies who died each year was more than double the number of white babies. At the time, tuberculosis was a scourge of many cities. More than six times as many Black Philadelphians as white died of the disease. Dr. Alexander also reported that Black patients experienced discrimination at hospitals. They described being treated in segregated wards, receiving substandard care, or being denied care altogether.  Dr. Alexander\u2019s work showed that these outcomes emerged from unequal social conditions. Racial segregation forced many Black people to live in overcrowded housing. Black neighborhoods rarely received adequate sanitation services from city government. In these conditions, diseases like tuberculosis spread much more easily. Racism in health care, education, and employment trapped many Black Americans in poverty. Most white doctors and public health experts did not consider the role of social and economic conditions in health. Dr. Alexander was part of a network of Black doctors, nurses, clergy, and reformers who identified the role of systemic racism in health disparities.  Dr. Alexander devoted much of the rest of her career to the field of public health. She earned a master\u2019s degree in public health from Yale University. She also worked for many years at Howard University in Washington, D.C.[3][4] Dr. Alexander advocated for the passage of the 1939 National Health Bill. This was an early attempt at establishing a national health insurance system. In the 1940s, she served with the US Public Health Service. She treated Black patients at the Slossfield Health Center in Birmingham, Alabama.[5]  Dr. Alexander was a member of the Society of Friends, also known as the Quakers. Her religious faith informed her life and work. She never married. According to one biographer, she had a romantic relationship with the scholar and activist W. E. B. Du Bois in the 1930s. Virginia Alexander died on July 24, 1949 of complications from lupus.

                "bodyText": "An American feminist, suffragist, suspected spy, prisoner of war and surgeon, Dr. Mary Edwards Walker remains the only women ever to receive the Medal of Honor, which she was awarded for her service during the Civil War.  She grew up in Oswego, New York, raised by her progressive parents along with her six brothers and sisters. \"Free thinkers,\" they were raised to question everything. Helping on the farm, Mary often wore trousers and shirts because they were more comfortable. She was a non-comformist throughout her life.  Walker graduated with a doctor of medicine degree from Syracuse Medical College in 1855. Following her graduation, she married her fellow medical student, Albert Miller, and they set up a joint practice in Rome, New York. The practice failed, ostensibly because the public would not accept a female doctor. She refused to agree to \"obey\" Albert in her wedding vows, kept her last name, and wore a short skirt and trousers instead of a traditional wedding dress; they later divorced. Dr. Walker was strongly opposed to traditional women's dress, arguing they were uncomfortable, inhibited mobility, and spread dust and dirt. Her typical clothes -- for which she was often mocked, punished, and treated as an oddity\u00a0-- were, in the 1860s, trousers with suspenders worn under a knee-length dress (later she would wear jackets and trousers almost exclusively). In 1860, she briefly attended Bowen Collegiate Institute in Hopkinton, Iowa.[1] She was suspended from the school for refusing to resign from the school's otherwise all-male debate team.\u00a0  At the onset of the Civil War, Dr. Walker traveled to Washington to join the Union army. She was denied a commission as a medical officer, but served anyway as an unpaid volunteer surgeon at the U.S. Patent Office Hospital in Washington.[2] In 1862, she worked as an unpaid field surgeon near the front lines at Fredericksburg and Chattanooga. Throughout the War, she wore men's clothing, arguing that doing so made her job easier.  In September 1863, Dr. Walker became the first female U.S. Army surgeon following her commission as a \"Contract Acting Assistant Surgeon (civilian)\" by the Army of the Cumberland. While serving as an assistant surgeon with the 52nd Ohio Infantry, she routinely crossed the lines to treat civilians. On one such foray in 1864, she was detained by Confederate troops and arrested for spying. While imprisoned, she continued to refuse to wear traditionally feminine clothing. After spending four months at the notorious Castle Thunder\u00a0prison near Richmond, Virginia Dr. Walker was freed in a prisoner exchange. During the remainder of the war, she served at the Louisville Women's Prison Hospital and at an orphan asylum in Clarksville, Tennessee.  After the war, Dr. Walker was awarded a disability pension for muscular atrophy that she suffered while in prison in Castle Thunder. Based on the recommendation of Major Generals Sherman and Thomas, President Andrew Johnson signed a bill on November 11, 1865, to present Walker with the Medal of Honor for Meritorious Service. The medal was stripped from her (and several others) by government action from 1916 to 1917. It was reinstated to her in 1977. She remains the only woman to receive the Medal of Honor. Dr. Walker\u00a0spent the remainder of her life advancing the cause of women's rights.  Her choice of profession and dress marked her for harassment and ridicule her whole life. In 1870, while she was in New Orleans, she was arrested because she was dressed as a man. The arresting officer twisted her arm, and asked if she had ever been in a relationship with a man (dressing outside of gendered norms at the time was seen as evidence of homosexuality). Dr. Walker was released from custody only after she was recognized by officers of the court. She was frequently arrested for wearning men's clothes, including her signature top hat. She responded to those who criticized her choices, \"I don't wear men's clothes, I wear my own clothes.\"  The ridicule and spectacle of Dr. Walker's clothing continued for the rest of her life. For example, in 1914, The Custom Cutters' Association of America (tailors) were having a meeting at the New Willard Hotel in Washington, DC.[3] Dr. Walker was a guest at the hotel at the time. The following proposition was made to the Custom Cutters' Association:  We will have with us tonight the flower and the cream of the custom cutters of the world. It will be a great occasion. We can make it even greater than we had expected it to be. There is now in this hotel Dr. Mary Walker, the only woman ever given permission by Congress to appear on the streets or in the House at any time or at any place in the garb and habiliments of mere man. Why should it not be a great thing to have the custom cutters, the clothiers of man, addressed by the only woman who has this remarkable privilege?  The organizers of the Custom Cutters' meeting agreed, and during the banquet, she was introduced as \"a novelty.\" Unfortunately, the Master of Ceremonies also introduced her as Miss Susan B. Anthony (who had died several years previous).[4]  Dr. Walker was active in the fight for suffrage, and tried to register to vote in 1871, but was denied. She was among the early advocates for women's suffrage who argued that the Constitution had already granted women the right to vote, and that all that was required was enabling legislation from Congress. In 1912 and 1914, she testified in front of the US House of Representatives in support of women's suffrage. She became\u00a0increasingly distanced from the mainstream fight for suffrage as people began to argue instead for a constitutional amendment recognizing women's right to vote.\u00a0 \u00a0 In her later years, Dr. Walker opened her home to those who were also ostracized, harassed, and arrested for not conforming to traditional ideas of how people should dress. Dr. Mary Walker died at her home on February 21, 1919. She was buried in a black suit at Rural Cemetery in Oswego, New York.

Born in North Carolina, Orlean Hawks Puckett received little formal education before she married John Puckett at about age sixteen. They settled close to his family near Groundhog Mountain in Patrick County. Her first child was born in 1862 but died a few months later of diphtheria. Of her 23 subsequent pregnancies, none of the children born living survived more than a few days, possibly as a result of Rh hemolytic disease.  Orlean Puckett and her husband moved in 1875 to a nearby farm in Carroll County, where he built a two-story log house. She first served as a midwife in 1889, when no doctor or other midwife could be found for a neighbor. Puckett soon began traveling around the region, sometimes up to twenty miles distant, to deliver babies. She never charged for her services and became known throughout the area for her compassion and skill, having never lost a mother or baby during the more than 1,000 deliveries she attended.  Orlean moved from her home in 1939 because of the construction of the Blue Ridge Parkway. However, she died three short weeks afterward. A small cabin on her property was preserved by the National Park Service, and is known to be Puckett Cabin.  Continuing her legacy of care, the Orlean Hawks Puckett Institute, in Asheville, North Carolina, works to promote and strengthen child, parent, and family development.  The Puckett Cabin is preserved at Milepost 189.1 on the Blue Ridge Parkway in southern Virginia.",

                "bodyText": "\"My office hours are any and all hours of the day and night.\" - Susan La Flesche Picotte  Susan La Flesche was born June 17, 1865 on Nebraska's Omaha reservation to Chief Iron Eye (Joseph La Flesche) and his wife One Woman (Mary Gale). As a young girl, she watched a sick American Indian woman wait all night for a white doctor who, after being called for several times, never came. The woman died the next day and, as La Flesche later wrote, she \"saw the need of my people for a good physician.\" Her father made sure Susan learned the traditions of her people, but also pushed his children to be educated in Euro-American society for their own survival. After a trip to Washington D.C. in the 1830s, he told his people \"There is a coming flood which will soon reach us, and I advise you to prepare for it.\" Chief Iron Eye sent Susan to the reservation's Presbyterian school where she learned English, and then to New Jersey's Hampton Institute at the age of 14 for further education. As a young woman, La Flesche applied to the Woman\u2019s Medical College of Pennsylvania. It was a bold move on her part. At this time, even the most privileged women in America\u00a0faced enormous backlash when attempting a medical degree. Male doctors wrote that academic stress could make women infertile and having smaller brains made them incapable of medical practice. Despite this, La Flesche graduated a year early and first in her class. Rejecting a potentially comfortable life on the east coast, she returned to the Omaha reservation and became the sole doctor for more than 1,200 people across 400+ miles. She was 24 years old. She married Henry Picotte in 1894 and had two sons (Caryl and Pierre). She once again defied expectations by continuing to serve her people relentlessly as their doctor, sometimes taking her children with her on house calls. In 1913, with\u00a0help from her husband and donations, she\u00a0opened the first hospital on a reservation that was not funded by the government. Unlike the absent doctor she remembered from her childhood, La Flesche Picotte\u00a0helped anyone who needed it, regardless of race or ethnicity. On September 18, 1915, Susan La Flesche Picotte passed away from chronic health issues after a life of dedicated service. She worked hard to build a bridge between two worlds as her father had advised, and it was evident at her funeral. Three priests eulogized her, but it was a member of the Omaha tribe who delivered the final words in the Omaha language. ",

Although Earl's work tended to eclipse Ann's, she played a critical role in his research. She is significant as a pioneer in archeology at a time when the discipline largely did not accept women's participation. \u00a0 Ann spent much of her time recording and painting architecture, petroglyphs and pictographs, and landscapes; as well as the everyday tasks of expedition life. She developed methods and standards for pictoral documentation that are still in use today. At a time when archeologists used black-and-white photography to record sites and artifacts, Ann's colorful drawings captured information that would have been lost. She also conducted ethnographic studies of indigenous people who had historically lived near archeological places.  \u00a0 Along with her artwork, Ann wrote two books about her experiences as an archeologist and the significance of her findings. \u201cDigging the Yucatan\u201d and \u201cDigging in the Southwest\u201d show her extensive knowledge and skill as an archeologist and provide a glimpse into her vibrant world. Ann worked at archeological excavations in places that are now national parks, including Aztec Ruins National Monument, Canyon de Chelly National Monument, and Mesa Verde National Park. \u00a0 Ann and Earl Morris had two daughters, Elizabeth Ann and Sarah Lane. \u00a0Elizabeth studied Anthropology at the University of Arizona, and following in her parents footsteps, became an Archaeologist and Professor at Colorado State University. \u00a0 For further information about Ann Axtell Morris and the work of other women in the field of federal archaeology, check out \u201cImplementing the Antiquities Act: A Survey of Archaeological Permits 1906-1935.\u201d  \u00a0  Sources:   Florence C.

A son in his position was expected to join the military, and so Cockburn did \u2013 attending the Royal Navigational School and enlisting in the Navy at the age of 9. He assisted as a Captain\u2019s servant on several ships throughout the 1780s, eventually being made lieutenant at age 19, and took command of a vessel of his own in 1793. Through service in the French Revolutionary Wars and the Napoleonic Wars, Cockburn was quickly promoted from lieutenant, to captain, and then commodore. When the War of 1812 began, Cockburn was promoted again to rear admiral, and sent to Bermuda to join Admiral Sir Alexander Cochrane in his attacks on the Americans. Cockburn\u2019s most lasting impression in the War of 1812 was the critical role he played in organizing raids along the Chesapeake under Cochrane\u2019s orders, including raiding the towns of Havre de Grace, Hampton, and Frenchtown. This earned him a very bad reputation in the American press as a savage and warmonger. Cockburn reveled in this portrayal as he planned and executed the sack of Washington, D.C. in 1814. Although scrupulous in ordering soldiers to damage only public property, he took personal delight in destroying the offices of the National Intelligencer that had lampooned him. This victory earned him an appointment as a Knight Commander of the Order of Bath shortly before the war ended. Following the War of 1812, and more military service in the Napoleonic Wars, Cockburn followed in his father\u2019s footsteps and was elected as a Member of Parliament in 1818. He served as First Naval Lord for Parliament and executed extensive improvements to the weapons and skills for gunnery in the British naval fleet, and ensured they had the latest steam technology available.\u00a0",

                "bodyText": "Harriet Robinson Scott was an enslaved woman whose determination to free herself and her family made history. She and her husband, Dred Scott, spent years living in free territory in what is now Minnesota. In the 1840s, the Scotts sued for their freedom in Missouri. Their case made its way to the Supreme Court. In 1857, the Court ruled against the family. Dred Scott v. Sandford hastened the outbreak of the U.S. Civil War. Historians regard it as one of the worst and most consequential Court rulings in U.S. history.  Slavery at Fort Snelling Harriet Robinson was born enslaved in Virginia around 1815. In the early 1830s her enslaver, Lawrence Taliaferro, brought her to Fort Snelling in\u00a0what was then the Northwest Territory.[1] Slavery was illegal there. But it was common for military officers to break the law by bringing enslaved people with them when they were reassigned to different postings.  In 1836, the man who would become Robinson\u2019s husband arrived: Dred Scott. Scott and Robinson met and married in 1836 or 1837. Although the government did not legally recognize marriages among enslaved people, Taliaferro united the couple in a civil ceremony. He transferred ownership of Harriet Scott to Dred Scott\u2019s owner, a military surgeon named John Emerson.  Over the next few years, Emerson moved the Scotts back and forth between free and slave territory. Their residence in free areas would become the centerpiece of their legal cases. At times, Emerson and his new wife, Eliza Irene Sanford, leased the Scotts out as hired slaves. They would work for other employers, and the Emersons would take their wages. Harriet probably worked doing laundry, cleaning houses, and caring for children. During one trip between Louisiana and Minnesota, Harriet gave birth her first daughter, Eliza, on a steamboat on the Mississippi River. A few years later Harriet had another daughter, Lizzie. In 1843, John Emerson died, and left the Scotts to his wife. She sent them back to St. Louis from Fort Snelling, where they were again hired out to work for other people. Freedom Suits Three years later, Harriet and Dred Scott determined that they would to take action to win their freedom. They filed separate petitions in the St. Louis Circuit Court.[2] Their cases rested on their residence at Fort Snelling, in free territory. Several free states had laws on the books that held that if an enslaved person lived there for a certain length of time with their owner\u2019s permission\u2014as both Scotts had done\u2014they would become free.Other enslaved people had claimed their freedom in this way. The Scotts likely received advice from John R. Anderson, the pastor at the church Harriet attended. Their lawyers offered evidence that Dred Scott had been treated as a free man while living at Fort Snelling. They pointed out that Lawrence Taliaferro had performed a civil marriage ceremony for the couple.The cases wended their way through the court system, and the Scotts endured years of delays and multiple appeals. In 1850, their lawyers decided to merge their two petitions into one, and Harriet\u2019s name was dropped in favor of her husband\u2019s. Dred Scott v. Sandford Finally, in 1857, the case, now titled Dred Scott v. Sandford, reached the US Supreme Court. Chief Justice Roger Taney wrote the majority opinion. He argued that the framers of the Constitution had believed that Black people had \u201cno rights which the white man was bound to respect.\u201d Enslaved or free, he ruled, Black people were not citizens of the United States. Dred Scott and other Black people therefore had no right to bring freedom suits.The Court also struck down the Missouri Compromise, which had banned slavery in most northern states and territories while allowing new areas in the South to enter the union as slave states. \u00a0The decision contributed to the start of the American Civil War four years later. Freedom for the Scotts The loss of their case was a devastating setback, but the Scotts gained their freedom a few months later. Their owner\u2014by then Taylor Blow\u2014freed them on May 26, 1857. Dred Scott died of tuberculosis less than a year later. Harriet Robinson Scott remained in St. Louis as a free woman. She worked as a laundress for many years. She died at the age of 61 on June 17, 1876 and was buried in Greenwood Cemetery, one of the first Black burial grounds in the city. Although her name is not as well-known as her husband\u2019s, her drive to secure freedom for herself and her family was equally powerful in changing the course of American history. \u00a0 Notes [1] Historic Fort Snelling is now part of the Mississippi National River and Recreation Area. It was designated a National Historic Landmark on December 19, 1960.[2] The first two trials of the case took place at the Old Courthouse in St. Louis, now part of Gateway Arch National Historic Site. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places on October 15, 1966. This site is also part of the NPS\u2019s National Underground Railroad Network to Freedom.

                "bodyText": "Katharine Lee Bates was a professor and writer best remembered as the author of the lyrics to the song \u201cAmerica the Beautiful.\u201d She shared a home for almost three decades with her companion, fellow academic and social reformer Katharine Coman.   Think of a time when you have felt inspired by the natural world. How did you express it? \u00a0 Early Life and Work Katharine Lee Bates\u00a0was born in Falmouth, Massachusetts in 1859. Her father died when she was just weeks old, and she was raised by her mother and aunt. Well-educated women themselves, they sent Bates to high school and then to Wellesley College.[1] She graduated in 1880 and took teaching work nearby.  In 1889, Bates published a poem, \u201cGoody Santa Claus on a Sleigh Ride\u201d in a collection called Sunshine and other Verses for Children. Her poem helped to popularize Mrs. Claus\u00a0in the public consciousness. That same year, Rose and Thorn, a young adult novel that she had written, won a prize. Bates used the prize money to fund a voyage to England. She studied at Oxford University in 1890 and 1891. After returning to the US, she became a professor of English literature at Wellesley and while there, completed her master\u2019s degree.  In addition to teaching, Bates wrote nonfiction, fiction, and poetry. She published in newspapers and magazines like the New York Times and the Atlantic Monthly. Active as a social reformer, she co-founded a settlement house in Boston called the Denison House. Denison House was modeled after Jane Addams\u2019 Hull House in Chicago.[2] Bates became involved in the global peace movement after World War I. She advocated for the formation of the League of Nations and considered herself a global citizen. Relationship with Katharine Coman In 1885, Bates met Katharine Coman, a professor of history and political economy at Wellesley. Bates and Coman lived together for many years in a home in Wellesley owned by the Bates family. Bates had dubbed the house \u201cThe Scarab\" after a visit to Egypt. The two women worked and traveled together. Although Bates destroyed most of their correspondence, surviving letters show a loving relationship. \u201cYou are always in my heart and in my longings,\u201d Bates wrote to Coman while studying in England. \u201cIt was the living away from you that made, at first, the prospect of leaving Wellesley so heartachy\u2026and it seemed least of all possible when I had just found the long-desired way to your dearest heart.\u201d After Coman\u2019s death from breast cancer in 1915, Bates wrote a memorial and a series of poems dedicated to her.  Cohabitation and close relationships among women were not uncommon in the 1800s. They are sometimes called \u201cBoston marriages.\u201d They allowed women to support each other and pursue career ambitions without being legally, socially, or financially constrained by marriage to a man. Some of these relationships were probably platonic friendships, while others were physically intimate. We cannot know the exact nature of Bates\u2019s and Coman\u2019s partnership, but it was clearly loving and central to their lives. \u201cAmerica the Beautiful\u201d In the summer of 1893, Bates took the trip that would inspire her best-known work. She traveled west to teach English for a few weeks at the Colorado Summer School in Colorado Springs. One day she joined a group of teachers for a trip by wagon and mule up Pikes Peak, a summit in the Rocky Mountains. When they reached the top, joy at the beauty of the landscape replaced Bates\u2019s exhaustion. Back at her hotel, she wrote the first draft of the poem that would become \u201cAmerica the Beautiful.\u201d  From her perch on top of one of the \u201cpurple mountain majesties,\u201d Bates was able to look out over the prairie grasses and wheat fields of Kansas.[3] She memorialized them in the song as \u201camber waves of grain.\u201d The line \u201cthine alabaster cities gleam\u201d nods to Bates\u2019s experience visiting the World\u2019s Columbian Exposition in Chicago. The fair was the first one to be entirely powered by electricity. Bates\u2019s experience as a reformer and her frustration with the inequalities of American life also made their way into the poem. \u201cAmerica! America/God shed His grace on thee,\u201d read the original version, \u201cTill selfish gain no longer stain/The banner of the free!\u201d  Read more about the places that inspired Bates to write \u201cAmerica the Beautiful.\u201d  The poem was set to a variety of different tunes over the years. The version we know today was published in 1910 set to a tune by Samuel A. Ward called \u201cModerna.\u201d  \u201cAmerica the Beautiful\u201d was well-established as a popular tune by the time of Bates\u2019s death in 1929. She is buried at Oak Grove Cemetery in Falmouth, MA.[4] Notes [1] Wellesley Congregational Church and Cemetery was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2014.

                "bodyText": "John Malvin was born in Prince William County, Virginia in 1795. He was the son of a slave and a free black woman. John Malvin was born free because children assumed the status of their mother. In 1802, John Malvin was bound to his father\u2019s owner where he learned carpentry, and to read and write. After a previous attempt to escape failed, John Malvin left Virginia for Ohio in 1827. In 1831, he and his wife Harriet Dorsey settled in Cleveland. He had several professions throughout his life \u2014 including a carpenter, a cook, and a canal boat captain.\u00a0 In His Own Words John Malvin wrote an autobiography of his life as a free black man during the time of slavery. It covers 50 years, 47 of which were spent living in Cleveland. John Malvin cared deeply about civil rights, establishing the first schools for black children in Ohio and becoming a prominent advocate for the rights of African Americans. John Malvin\u2019s autobiography was first published by the\u00a0Cleveland Leader\u00a0in 1879. These quotes help us understand how difficult life was for black people, even in a slavery-free state like Ohio. Traveling to Cleveland by Canal \u201cMy wife met me in Cincinnati, and then we started up the Ohio River as far as Portsmouth, Ohio, with what little household goods we had. My object was to reach Chillicothe, to which point the Ohio Canal had been completed, and then travel by way of the canal. I hired a team to take us and our goods to Chillicothe, and from there we traveled on the canal to Newark, in Licking county. By this time cold weather had set in, and we were compelled to spend the winter in Newark. In the following April, the canal being again open, we proceeded on our journey, and arrived in Cleveland the same month. There was very little communication between the United States and Canada in those days, so we waited in Cleveland for a good opportunity to cross over into Canada, and finding no opportunity in Cleveland we went to Buffalo [New York], where we stayed a few days\u2026  Here [in Buffalo] my wife became greatly troubled in consequence of having left her father, and it lay so heavily upon her that she gave me no rest. Seeing her unwillingness to go to Canada, and her fears that she would never see her father again, I concluded to give up the farm, and my wife having taken a fancy to Cleveland, we determined to go back and settle there\u2026I sought employment at my trade [carpentry]. But my color was an obstacle and I could not get work of that kind. I managed, however, to obtain employment as cook on the schooner Aurora, that sailed on the lakes between Mackinaw [Michigan] and Buffalo.\u201d   Racism \u201cI thought upon coming to a free State like Ohio, that I would find every door thrown open to receive me, but from the treatment I received by the people generally, I found it little better than in Virginia\u2026Thus I found every door closed against the colored man in a free State, excepting the jails and penitentiaries, the doors of which were thrown wide open to receive him. I was for some time uncertain whether to remain in Ohio, or to return to Virginia, but at length concluded to remain in Ohio for a time, not knowing what to do.\u201d Buying a Boat \u201cMy earnings while in Mr. Hudson\u2019s employ, were barely sufficient to support my family. Through the kindness of Mr. James S. Clark, I was enabled to purchase, on easy terms, a vessel owned by Abraham Wright of Rockport. When I went to take out a license, the deputy Collector refused to grant it, deciding that my color was an obstacle. But when the Collector himself arrived, who was the Hon. Samuel Starkweather, well known to all the citizens of Cleveland, he decided that I had as much right to own and sail a vessel upon the lakes as I had to own a horse and buggy and drive through the streets, and he granted me a license. My vessel was called \u201cThe Grampus.\u201d After I obtained my license, Mr. Diodate Clark employed me to carry limestone and cedar posts from Kelley\u2019s and surrounding islands [in Lake Erie].\u201d Canal Boat Captain \u2018\u201c[In 1840], [I] purchased a canal boat from S.R. Hutchinson & Co\u2026My boat, which was called the \u201cAuburn,\u201d was engaged in conveying wheat and merchandise on the Ohio Canal. The boat was a good passenger packet, with good cabins, and her former owners concluded to buy the boat back, which they did. They then employed me as captain, to manage her. On one occasion\u2026we arrived at Niles, [Ohio] about nine o\u2019clock in the evening. At this place we were hailed by some person saying that a passenger wanted to get aboard to go south. We came alongside the dock and landed. Pretty soon after some baggage came on board, and in a short time the owner of the baggage, who was a female, appeared.  My crew consisted of one white steersman, one colored steersman, two white drivers, one colored bowsman, and one colored female cook. When the lady arrived I stood aboard of the stern deck and assisted her aboard. When she went down into the cabin and saw the colored cook, she was taken completely by surprise. The colored steersman just then happened to go down into the cabin after something. The lady was sitting on the locker, and when she saw the colored steersman she went immediately to the other side of the boat. After the bowsman had got his line snugly curled, he went down into the cabin, and she accosted him, saying that she would like to see the captain. Accordingly, I was called and went down to see what she wanted. The light shone in my face so that she could easily see my features. The lady, after seeing me, suddenly sprang to her feet, and with great shortness of breath exclaimed, \u201cWell, I never! Well, I never! Well, I never!\u201d I made a bow and left her, and ordered the cook to set her state-room doors open, and take off all the bedding from the middle berth, and supply clean bedding from the locker, so that she might see that the bedding was changed, and I requested the cook to tell the surprised lady to take the middle berth. She refused to go to bed, and sat up all night.  We arrived at Lock 21, north end of Akron locks, at midnight. At nearly every lock there was a house or grocery, and I instructed the crew to keep the blinds on the boat closed, so that the lady should not know she was in a village; for, seeing that she was afraid of colored people, I wanted to giver her full opportunity of getting acquainted with them before she arrived at her home in Circleville. We arrived at Lock 1 a little after daylight\u2026I invited the lady to breakfast, which she refused, saying that she did not feel very well...I [later] invited the lady to dinner. She still complained of not feeling very well, but took a piece of pie from where she stood. Then we arrived at the Bethlehem level, and when tea was ready, I invited her to tea, and she took a cup of tea and a biscuit.  [That night] I suppose the lady took a good night\u2019s sleep, for I did not hear anything from her until the next morning. When breakfast was ready, on receiving an invitation, she readily took a seat at the table, and ate a hearty meal, and from that time on she felt reconciled to her surroundings, and conversed freely with the cook and all on board. When we arrived at Circleville she left us. I provided means for the conveyance of her baggage, and on her leaving she thanked me, and said, \u2018Captain, when I first came aboard your boat, not being accustomed to travel in this way, I supposed I must have acted quite awkward. Now, I must return my thanks to you and your crew, for the kind treatment I have received. I never traveled so comfortably in all my life, and I expect to go north soon, and I will defer my journey until you are going north, even if I am obliged to wait two or three days.\u2019 I never saw the lady again after that.\u201d Learn More His grave in the Erie\u00a0Street Cemetery is just north of the\u00a0large dark \"Barnet\" monument.

                "bodyText": "Clara Lemlich Shavelson is known primarily for her part in the 1909 garment workers strike in New York City, often referred to as the Uprising of 20,000. At the time, immigrants dominated New York City garment industry jobs, with many of the low-skilled positions going to immigrant women. Employees worked long hours, often in dangerous conditions for low wages with no protections. In these working conditions, collective action through the union labor movement proved crucial to the well-being of workers in the garment trade.  Born in Ukraine in 1886, Shavelson emigrated to the United States with her family in 1904. In New York City, she found work in a garment factory. She officially joined the International Ladies\u2019 Garment Workers' Union (ILGWU) in 1906 and was a member of her local executive board. With her emphasis on \u201crevolutionary thinking\u201d and willingness both to speak her mind and put her physical safety on the line, Shavelson became well known in the garment trades as an agitator and organizer for workers\u2019 rights, and was instrumental in strikes in several factories between 1906 and 1909. She led worker strikes at both the Weissen & Goldstein Factory and the Leiserson Factory, and was a regular speaker on picket lines around Manhattan.  Her star turn came in November 1909. Taking the stage at a union meeting at Cooper Union, following several union leaders, including American Federation of Labor president Samuel Gompers and Women\u2019s Trade Union League President Mary Dreier, Lemlich demanded action\u2013a strike. Recalling the strike years later, Lemlich noted that she was compelled to speak: \u201c[I] had fire in my mouth,\u201d she explained.1  After the strike, Shavelson found work as an organizer for the Wage Earners Suffrage League. Building on her experience leading strikes, she tied the demand for the vote to labor struggles. Shavelson framed them as part of the same fight\u2014 as women working to support their families, they wanted their voices heard, both in the workplace and in government. While she had commanded respected from male garment workers as a union leader, her involvement in the women\u2019s suffrage movement led them to throw rotten tomatoes at her \u201cwhen they saw her talking up suffrage to women workers\u201d outside of garment factories.2  In 1912, she married, moved to Brooklyn, and started a family, leaving garment work, and exchanging union and suffrage organizing for a different kind. In Brooklyn, she organized women in her neighborhood\u2013wives and mothers\u2013to engage in consumer activism such as food boycotts and rent strikes. For Shavelson, the personal was political, and she was well aware of the effects that collective action, could have, whether from a group of workers or of housewives. She believed that sweeping social change was necessary and possible. Her beliefs led her to join the Communist Party, where she found others who were committed to revolutionary thinking in the same way she was. In a conversation with her daughter Martha, Shavelson said of her move away from organized labor that \u201cthe great majority of workers merely believe you have to get a little more pay. A Communist wants more than that. You joined for a higher life.\u201d3  Mindful of her early days without access to education, Shavelson organized reading and discussion groups for housewives in her neighborhood. She ran for New York City and State office, and campaigned for other candidates whose vision she believed in. She raised money for unions out on strike, and led delegations of people to City Hall and to Washington, D.C. in support of lower food prices, federal unemployment, and world peace. Along with her husband Joe, she raised her children in an activist household.  Shavelson ended a 1965 letter recounting her involvement in the 1909 strike by saying that \u201cinsofar as I am concerned, I am still at it.\u201d4 True to her word, Shavelson convinced the administration of her retirement home in California to support the United Farm Workers produce boycott, and helped the nurses there organize for union representation. She died in California in July 1982.  \u2014 Notes [1] Von Drehle, Dave, Triangle: The Fire that Changed America (New York: Atlantic Monthly Press, 2003), 9.

                "bodyText": "A dynamic speaker and energetic union organizer, Leonora O\u2019Reilly also made a significant contribution to the passage of women\u2019s suffrage legislation at the state and federal levels. O\u2019Reilly succeeded in forging ties between working-class women and their middle- and upper-class counterparts, sensing the potentially transformative nature of such alliances even as she critiqued more privileged allies for their insensitivity to the struggles faced by the poor and working-class.  O\u2019Reilly was a leader in the settlement house movement and played an integral role in the creation and growth of the Women\u2019s Trade Union League (WTUL), an organization dedicated to labor organizing and to legislative action. In 1911, she co-founded the Wage Earner\u2019s Suffrage League in New York City, a dynamic organization aimed at engaging working women in the struggle for women\u2019s enfranchisement.  Born in New York City on February 16, 1870 to Irish immigrant parents, O\u2019Reilly began working in a garment factory at the age of eleven. There she experienced firsthand the harsh realities of industrial labor and the challenges faced by women in the workforce. While still a teenager, she joined the Knights of Labor, then the nation\u2019s largest labor organization as well as one of the most open to welcoming female members. In 1886, O\u2019Reilly joined the Working Women\u2019s Society, a group that included both wage-earning women and middle-class reformers and advocated for higher pay, safer conditions, and shorter hours.  By the late 1890s, O\u2019Reilly had established herself as one of the leading voices for the rights of female workers in New York City. She gave public speeches and advocated for reform legislation, all the while continuing to work in factories. O\u2019Reilly also taught at an industrial school and worked in settlement houses during this period, even forming a short-lived cooperative shirtwaist sewing room.  In 1903, she co-founded the New York City Chapter of the WTUL. For over a decade, O\u2019Reilly worked as an organizer and recruiter for the organization, receiving an annual annuity for her labor from 1909-1914. In 1909-1910, she served as a key activist for the WTUL during a large strike by shirtwaist workers in the city, organized by the International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union. The following year, she helped to organize protests in the wake of the devastating Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire. The WTUL proved to be quite influential, though it received almost no support from the American Federal of Labor (AFL) or other male-dominated labor organizations.  O\u2019Reilly was among the first female labor activists to publicly campaign for women\u2019s suffrage. She attended meetings on the subject as early as 1900 and, between roughly 1907 and 1911, participated actively in the Equality League of Self-Supporting Women, an organization founded by Harriet Stanton Blatch. O\u2019Reilly was vice-president in 1907 and on the board for several years thereafter. In 1911, she co-founded (along with Rose Schneiderman) a New York branch of the Wage Earners\u2019 Suffrage League, which was created by and for working women. League activists regularly spoke in community settings and incorporated pro-suffrage messages as part of labor organizer campaigns. The League organized a large rally on April 22, 1912 at Cooper Union. All the speakers, including O\u2019Reilly herself, had worked in the garment industry. \u00a0  Throughout the 1910\u2019s and early 1920s, O\u2019Reilly continued to campaign for the rights of working women. She also became active in the anti-war and civil rights movements, joining the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) shortly after its creation. After suffering from heart disease for several years, Leonora O\u2019Reilly died at the age of 57 on April 3, 1927. \u00a0 Bibliography Collens, Jacklyn. \"Cultivating Solidarity: Leonora O'Reilly, Working-Class Women, and Middle-Class Allies in the American Woman Suffrage Movement.\" Masters thesis, Sarah Lawrence College, 2016. \u00a0  McCarthy, Tara.

                "bodyText": "Maud Malone was born in New York City to Annie Malone and Dr. Edward Malone, both of whom were Irish immigrants. Both her father and her uncle Father Sylvester Malone (a priest) were among the founders of the New York Anti-Poverty Society. Maud's social activism and awareness ran in the family.  Maud Malone brought two important innovations to the women's suffrage movement in the US: open air meetings and parades. But if you look for Maud in the history books, chances are you won\u2019t find her.\u00a0  Personally, Maud was described as quiet, even bashful, with a winning smile, but in public she could spar with the best of them. Part of a Brooklyn family that supported underdogs and unpopular causes, she had grown up going to political meetings with her family in Manhattan\u2019s Cooper Union.[1] She described their home as \u201ca hotbed of activity whenever elections or any other political events took place.\u201d\u00a0  Maud herself was especially interested in women\u2019s suffrage. The Manhattan librarian was frustrated that, by 1905, only four states allowed women to vote, all in the west. New York state was nowhere near considering women\u2019s suffrage. To restart the movement, more people needed to be engaged. But how? The people who showed up to suffrage meetings already agreed with their ideas.\u00a0  Maud liked to take long walks in New York City. On these walks, she saw Salvation Army preachers gather large crowds in public. She also noticed Socialists gathering workers outside of factory yards. Maybe women could also speak publicly in parks and on sidewalks and convert men and women to their cause. Later on, she said, \u201cI decided that if we wanted to vote we had to go to the people and ask for it.\u201d\u00a0  Image: Maud Malone speaks at the first outdoor meeting concerning suffrage, Decemer 31, 1907. Bain News Service collection, Library of Congress.\u00a0   Maud belonged to several women\u2019s clubs, where women debated all kinds of issues. She shared her idea of speaking publicly on the street. At first, women club members refused, saying they would lose all respectability. But soon, women suffragists in Britain began holding their own street meetings. By 1907, Maud convinced her fellow members of the Harlem Equal Rights League to hold open-air meetings about suffrage, like their sisters in Great Britain. They would collect signatures calling on New York state legislators to grant women the right to vote.  Maud\u2019s first open air suffrage meeting took place December 31,1907 in Madison Square Park. She, along with British reformer Bettina Borrmann Wells, collected hundreds of signatures. Reporters admired how Maud used humor and sarcasm in question and answer sessions with the mostly male audience.\u00a0  \u201cDo women know enough to vote?\u201d asked one man.  \u201cI guess they know as much as any of you men.\u201d  \u201cHow do you know?\u201d  \u201cWhy, I can tell by looking into your faces!\u201d (Cheers.)  The open air meeting was followed by others. With more women choosing to participate after all, Maud introduced another new tactic from Britain: the parade.  At the time, suffrage leaders like Carrie Chapman Catt strongly opposed the idea. But the first parade on February 16, 1908 attracted about 2,000 men. They even defied a police ban, strolling up Broadway from Union Square to 23rd Street to a suffrage meeting, where the crowd stretched into the street.[2] There were no arrests. Unlike the violent British rallies, reporters saw Americans having fun.   Image: The crowd in the suffrage parade up Broadway on February 16, 1908. Maud Malone is the taller woman near the center of the photo. Bain News Service collection, Library of Congress.   Soon, suffrage parades were everywhere. \u201cSince we have become more militant,\u201d she said later, \u201cwe have won our greatest victories.\u201d In 1915, New York state voters rejected granting women the right to vote, but two years later, voters had another chance. This time, voters approved women suffrage. The 1917 victory in New York state was a major catalyst in granting women the right to vote nationally three years later.  Meanwhile, Maud had moved on to other tactics. Now she was questioning politicians during their speeches. Sometimes she was arrested. In 1917, she was among the suffragists who picketed the White House. When organizations failed to live up to her passion and ideals---even groups she had founded---she quit them. When she left her own Progressive Women\u2019s Suffrage Union, she said, \u201cThe movement to be truly progressive should recognize no prejudice of race, color, difference in clothes or creed, whether religious or economic\u2026\u201d Politically, she kept moving ever leftward in search of others who agreed with her brand of militancy.  When not working for woman suffrage, Maud worked for the New York Public Library. In 1917, she was a founding member of the Library Employees' Union, the first labor union in the United States representing public library employees. Maud was just as outspoken in her union activity as she was elsewhere, using suffrage tactics to advocate for better working conditions -- particularly for women library workers.\u00a0In 1932, the New York Public Library fired her. She later worked as librarian for the\u00a0Daily Worker\u00a0newspaper. Maud died in 1951.  Maud Malone was an innovator who refused to compromise her ideals. Sadly, she has been forgotten in the history of women suffrage. As we commemorate the Centennial of the 19th Amendment, we should remember that change belongs to the risk-takers, like the fighting Malones. Sometimes, they remain on the outside, even as they open the doors for others to walk through.  The series Maud Malone: New York City Librarian and Suffrage Powerhouse has more information about this remarkable person.

                "bodyText": "Homestead #6214 - Application Number 14748 \u2013 March 17, 1892  America Hunt, a mulatto woman, was born into slavery in Kentucky\u00a0in approximately 1820. By 1840, she belonged to Henry Hunt and lived on his plantation near Liberty, Amite County, Mississippi. America had children by her slave owner, Henry Hunt (proven through DNA). Two were Margaret and Peter Hunt. Oral family history states that Margaret was a weaver on the plantation, and Peter was a Tanner of animal hides. America eventually married Joshua Hunt, a former slave of Henry Hunt. In total, America had seven children.  In approximately 1856, Henry Hunt moved them to Franklin County, near Roxie, Mississippi. Emancipation occurred on January 1, 1863. Yet, in 1865, Josh, America, and other family members were farming on the same property enumerated on the Registry of Freedmen residing on the plantation of Henry Hunt in Franklin County, Mississippi.  By 1870, Joshua and America changed their name from Hunt to Harrell along with their daughters, who were Jane Harrell-Oats (John), Harriet Harrell-Pickett (Richard \u201cJake\u201d), Louisa Harrell-Jackson (Winston), and Sarah Harrell. Their former owner, Henry Hunt, also died in 1870.  America was a widow by\u00a0February of 1883 when she filed for a 39.35 acre homestead under the Homestead Act of 1862. Within nine years, America, with her children\u2019s help and hired hands, built a 16-foot square log cabin, which consisted of a bed, bureau, chair, and table. They also made three\u00a0log corn cribs. America farmed fifteen\u00a0acres of the land, planting corn and potatoes, as the rest of the land was piney woods.  The neighbors who were witnesses for her final homestead application were J.M. Halford, \u201cG.C.\u201d George Columbus Adams, and Joe Turner. The two closest people living next to America were her son, Peter Hunt, and neighbor Ben Lands. When America proved up on her homestead her farm\u00a0yielded 100 bushels of corn and\u00a050 bushels of potatoes. She owned\u00a0plows, hoes, a turning plow, a weeder, one horse, five heads of cows, and one yearling. Her land, home, and corn cribs\u2019 total value\u00a0were noted at $130.00 in 1892  The descendants of America Hunt-Harrell are proud of her. She was a tenacious, hard-working woman, despite her life circumstances. Although America was born a slave, after 20 years of freedom, she purchased land, lived in her own home, worked\u00a0for herself, never being enslaved again in any capacity.

                "bodyText": "Anna Pauline \u201cPauli\u201d Murray was born in Baltimore, Maryland on November 20, 1910. Her mother died of a cerebral hemorrhage in 1914. Her father, a teacher in the Baltimore public school system, suffered from depression and was eventually confined to a state mental hospital where he was murdered by a white guard in 1923. Orphaned at age fourteen, Murray moved to Durham, North Carolina to live with her aunt and her grandparents. After graduating with distinction from high school in 1926, Murray arrived in New York City to attend Hunter College. She graduated in 1933 with a degree in English Literature. It was at this time and throughout the 1930s that Murray\u2019s struggles with gender became central to her life. She changed her name to \u201cPauli\u201d to represent a more androgynous identity. Historian Rosalind Rosenberg, author of Jane Crow: The Life of Pauli Murray, asserts that Murray identified as a transgender man but did not have the information or acceptance available during her lifetime to describe it. During the Great Depression, Murray worked for the Works Projects Administration (WPA), the Workers Defense League, and as a teacher in New York City. She published articles and poems in various magazines, including The Crisis, a publication of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). Murray soon became involved in the civil rights movement. Her unsuccessful attempt to enter graduate school at the all-white University of North Carolina received national publicity. During this time, Murray developed a life-long friendship and correspondence with Eleanor Roosevelt. Murray worked to end segregation on public transport. Her activism in March 1940 led to Murray\u2019s arrest and imprisonment for refusing to sit at the back of a bus in Richmond, Virginia. In 1941, Murray enrolled at Howard University law school with the intention of becoming a civil rights lawyer. The following year she joined George Houser, James Farmer, and Bayard Rustin to form the nonviolence-focused Congress of Racial Equality (CORE). It was during her years at Howard that she became acutely aware of the oppression she faced as a woman, coining the term \u201cJane Crow\u201d to describe her experience. Graduating at the top of her class in 1944, Murray was recipient of the prestigious Rosenwald Fellowship. Previous graduates had used the fellowship to attend Harvard University, but Murray\u2019s application to Harvard Law School was rejected on basis of gender. The discrimination faced on the basis of sexual orientation would inform much of her work in civil rights. After receiving her Master of Laws degree from the University of California at Berkeley, Murray returned to New York City and provided support to the growing civil rights movement. In 1951, She published States\u2019 Laws on Race and Color. Thurgood Marshall, head of the legal department at the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), described Murray\u2019s book as the \u201cBible\u201d for civil rights litigators. Like many Black citizens involved in the civil rights movement, Murray was a victim of McCarthyism. In 1952, she lost a US State Department post at Cornell University because the people who had supplied her references (Eleanor Roosevelt, Thurgood Marshall, and A. Philip Randolph) were considered radical. A few years later, Murray joined a new law firm, Paul, Weiss, Rifkin, Wharton, and Garrison, where she met her partner Irene Barlow. After traveling throughout Ghana in 1960 to explore her African cultural roots and teach law, Murray returned to the United States and received her J.S.D. from Yale University, the first African American to receive this degree. While there, Murray mentored several young women activists, including Marian Wright Edelman, Eleanor Holmes Norton, and Patricia Roberts Harris, who would also become notable leaders. Murray continued her activism throughout the 1960s. President John F. Kennedy appointed Murray to the Committee on Civil and Political Rights as a part of his Presidential Commission on the Status of Women. Working closely with A. Philip Randolph, Bayard Rustin, and Martin Luther King, Jr., Murray criticized the disparity between the major role Black women played in the crucial grass-roots struggle and their minor representation national policy-making decisions. In 1966, Murray joined Betty Friedan and others to found the National Organization for Women (NOW), but later relinquished a leading role, believing the issues of Black and working-class women were not adequately addressed by the organization. From 1968 to 1973, Murray joined the faculty at Brandeis University. Following the death of her longtime partner Irene Barlow in 1973, Murray left Brandeis to become a candidate for ordination at General Theological Seminary. In 1977, Murray became the first African American woman in the US to become an Episcopal priest. Murray\u2019s pioneering work on gender discrimination was fundamental to the Equal Protection Clause's approach that racial discrimination should apply equally to gender-based discrimination. Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg credited Murry\u2019s legal strategy as the inspiration for her 1971 brief in Reed v. Reed, which ruled that women could not be excluded as administrators of personal estates based on their gender. The Equal Protection Clause has since served as precedent for many sex discrimination arguments. Murray died of cancer in Pittsburgh on July 1, 1985.

He was described as 5'10\" tall, gray eyes, mulatto, and hard to distinguish from a white man. Peter had been taught to read and write. His mother, also enslaved, was named America\u00a0Hunt. Peter's\u00a0father was Henry Hunt, their slave owner. Henry Hunt moved his family and slaves to Franklin County, Mississippi\u00a0in approximately 1856, where Peter was trained to be a tanner on the plantation, according to family history. In January 1864, newly freed from slavery, Peter enlisted in the Union Army\u2019s newly formed United States Colored Troops, 6th, Heavy Artillery, Co. L -\u00a0serving from 1864-1866 as a garrison guard. He was promoted from a private to a sargent. He was partially disabled after a terrible bout of measles while in the USCT and received a military pension for his disability.\u00a0Peter is listed on the African American Civil War Memorial\u00a0\u00a0in Washington, D.C. (#A-16). In 1872, Peter married Emily Shavers, and in 1873, their son, Albert Hunt, was born. In 1874 Peter claimed 157.38 acres of land, and friends and relatives helped him work the land. Upon proving up on his 157.38 acre\u00a0homestead in 1881;\u00a0Peter had built his home, cultivated 25 acres for farming, and built five structures, which were two corn cribs, one kitchen, one smokehouse, and one cotton house. His witnesses were Richard \u201cJake\u201d Pickett and Nat Foster. Peter Hunt\u2019s mother, America Hunt-Harrell (Harrold) homesteaded an adjourning 39.35 acres of land she claimed in February 1883 and proved up on in 1892. Peter's only child, Albert, gave him 10 grandchildren \u2013 John, Charley, Houston, Wilson, Thompson, Margaret, Cornelious, Claricy, Pearla, and Virginia. \u00a0Peter also raised his sister Margaret's three children after her death. Their names were Abel, Eula, and Abigail. Peter Hunt\u2019s family now knows about his life story and legacy that now encompasses five generations. We are so very proud of him, his legacy, and his accomplishments during a turbulent time in American history.  ~ Contributed by Denise Griggs About Denise Griggs Denise I.

                "bodyText": "George Paysinger made settlement in Bossier Parish, Louisiana in December, 1874, several years after emancipation. \u00a0  George established actual residence on January 24, 1875, when he completed homestead entry #1039 at the Natchitoches, Louisiana Land Office, under the Homestead Act of 1862. George fulfilled all of the requirements, including building a house and time living on the land, to receive a patent on August 3, 1882. The 160.60-acre parcel was located just east of Plain Dealing, Louisiana and ran north toward the Arkansas border. \u00a0\u00a0  George was a master architect, builder, craftsman and a farmer. Among many achievements in his life George, as a former enslaved person, served as a Juror for the 2nd Judicial Court in Bossier Parish on April 3, 1882. During the years which homesteaders are required to make proof in support of their entries George Paysinger, his wife and five children made numerous improvements to the property. They cleared and fenced about fifteen acres; constructed two cabins for residences, a smoke house, corn crib, cotton house, and a wagon shelter. In addition, ten acres were cleared where they grew cotton/corn. George had neighbors with whom he had close relationships with for over twenty years, some during his enslavement.  Several of George\u2019s neighbors and longtime acquaintances agreed to serve as the required witnesses to testify for his homestead entry. Cornelius Howell and Henry C. Wyche completed the two witness testimony statements. \u00a0S. C. O\u2019Daniel, R.E. Wyche, J. N. Bryan, Ernest Wyche, and at least one other also agreed to serve as witnesses on February 10, 1880 to provide final proof of claim. It is noteworthy that J.N. Bryan a former enslaver of George Paysinger is among these witness signatures.  The Bossier Banner published a notice on February 10, 1880, of the intention of George Paysinger to make final proof of his homestead claim on Tuesday, March 25, 1880. The publication listed the claim as #1039, for the east half of the southwest quarter and the west half of the southeast quarter of section 14, township 23, north of range 13, west of Louisiana Meridian. George completed the Final Affidavit Required of Homestead Claimants at the Natchitoches, Louisiana Land Office on June 3, 1880. \u00a0  The Natchitoches Land Office ultimately issued Final Certificate #434 for homestead application #1039 on August 3, 1882.This 160-acre Homestead Land Patent was only a segment of the land George Paysinger acquired during his lifetime. Before the land patent was final, in 1877 the family that enslaved George prior to emancipation either deeded or sold him 140 acres. He also purchased another 160 acres from the Bossier Parish School Board in April 1885 and 40 acres of state land in 1887, totaling 500 acres. George lived out his life on the land he acquired and a portion of the land still remains with his heirs.  The Paysinger Desk  The desk was crafted by George Paysinger, who was also credited by some historians with building Orchard Place, the main residence on the Orchard Plantation in Bossier Parish. It is probably a vernacular version of a Federal style desk. It is hand made of heart pine. It originally had a drop-front and is dated to the middle to late 1800s. John Hamiter, great-grandfather of the donor and enslaver of George Paysinger, was the owner. The pine boards that the desk is made with are almost a full 2 feet in width. Mid-1800s virgin timber was used in the construction. The desk originally had four keyed locks. A complete restoration of the piece was completed in 2002 and is on display at the Bossier Parish Library History Center.  ~ Contributed by Felix L. Scott Jr., descendant  Felix Lewis Scott Jr. is a 3rd great grandson of Louisiana Homesteader George Paysinger. Scott, a Colorado native, has experienced two distinctly different professions and is a 30-year entrepreneur. He apprenticed under his father's tutelage as a cement mason and like his 3rd great grandfather, became a proficient builder specializing in a wide range of concrete applications from flatwork/foundations to bridges and high-rise buildings. Scott later utilized education acquired at the University of Colorado to endeavor a career with the Colorado Department of Corrections. He fulfilled 22 years with the State of Colorado advancing to Facility Operations Manager before retiring. Scott and his wife Teresa also established and operated a successful local business, Ebony Salon, since 1991. Felix Scott Jr. is currently on a \u201cretirement\u201d exploration journey into his nuclear family and family history/genealogy; finding joy in unearthing extraordinary relations like his great-great-great grandfather George Paysinger.

                "bodyText": "A labor organizer and advocate for women\u2019s suffrage, Margaret \u201cMaggie\u201d Hinchey rose to national prominence in the early decades of the 20th century. Her passionate speeches advocated for both economic justice and political equality for women. A longtime laundry worker, Hinchey intimately understood the struggle to survive in industrial America. She spoke especially of the need for poor and working-class women to gain access to the electoral system, so that their needs would be better represented. In the 1910s, she toured the country from New York City to Butte, Montana, speaking to large crowds of mostly working-class men and union members, urging them to support women\u2019s access to the ballot.  Born in the late 19th century in Ireland, Hinchey immigrated to the United States with her family before the turn-of-the-century.1\u00a0She lived in New York City and worked long days and nights in commercial laundries for little pay. In January 1912, tens of thousands of the city\u2019s laundry workers went on strike and Hinchey joined them, even though she held a position as forewoman. Police arrested her during the strike, and afterwards, her reputation as an activist made it hard to find work in the industry.  Hinchey\u2019s skills as an organizer and public speaker caught the attention of women trade unionists and their middle-class allies. She became friends with Leonora O\u2019 Reilley, whose family had also immigrated from Ireland. O\u2019Reilly worked for the Women\u2019s Trade Union League (WTUL) and was active in the women\u2019s suffrage movement. In subsequent years, Hinchey and O\u2019Reilly would remain friends, and in letters the two women vented their frustrations regarding the largely privileged character of the early 20th century suffrage movement.  In 1913, Hinchey began working as a paid speaker and organizer for the National American Woman Suffrage Association (NAWSA) and its New York State affiliate, the Women\u2019s Suffrage Party. She spoke at large conventions, including the 1913 NAWSA national meeting, and to small groups of union members, making the case for women\u2019s access to the ballot. She also appeared at events sponsored by the Wage Earners\u2019 Suffrage League, an organization led by working-class women.  Hinchey continued to support striking workers on picket lines and in protests during this time as well. In fact, she spent 30 days in the New York City jail in 1913 for picketing during a hat makers strike. Afterwards, she authored an article on the experience for the journal Life and Labor, which included a cogent\u00a0analysis of how poverty itself was often criminalized by the state.2  In February 1914, Hinchey\u00a0made her way to Washington D.C. She was part of a delegation of working women, numbering in the hundreds, headed to the capital to demand the vote from President Woodrow Wilson. After arriving, Hinchey visited the White House. She was one of four women to address the president directly.  That summer, she continued her efforts as a suffrage campaigner, traveling across the country, including to Ohio, Montana, and upstate New York, arguing for women\u2019s voting rights. Her message in these speeches was clear, supporting women\u2019s suffrage was an act of class solidarity. \u00a0Speaking to a gathering of male union members in Dayton, Ohio in October 1914, Hinchey stated, \u201cThe workingman has a strong sense of justice. He will not refuse the working woman the same protection he himself enjoys\u2026Besides, he knows it is time that his own wife and daughter had a voice in electing the lawmakers of the country which their combined labor helps to make strong and great.\u201d3  Between 1915 and 1917, Hinchey played an important in role in the campaign to win women\u2019s suffrage in New York State. She gave speeches and organized potential supporters in the streets and in the workplaces of New York City. The ballot initiative failed in 1915, but eventually passed in 1917.  The success of the New York initiative, however, led to Hinchey losing her job with the Women\u2019s Suffrage Party. Attention had now turned to passing a national constitutional amendment. Dejected, Hinchey returned to the commercial laundry industry, later taking a job in domestic service. Her changed circumstances are a stark reminder of the challenges faced by working women in their pursuit of political change. While wealthier suffragists could rely on family support, women like Hinchey and Leonora O\u2019Reilly had few such financial resources to turn to in times of hardship. Despite her personal setbacks, Hinchey never lost her passion for women\u2019s rights and labor organizing. She continued to support union organizing and became a staunch advocate of the Equal Rights Amendment. Margaret Hinchey died in New York City on February 29, 1944.  Footnotes 1.

Most of his land was piney woods.  For several years Peter Clark cleared five of the 159.33 acres of land to build a house, outhouse and, grow an assortment of crops to sustain and support his family. He had a network of family and friends who resided near him throughout the seven years he was required to live on the land to help him.  He asked the following individuals to serve as witnesses to testify on his behalf Charles Baptiste, Henry Tinkshell, Marshall Douglas, Alfred Robinson and Ida and Robert Benefield.  The Southland newspaper published a notice for six consecutive weeks beginning October 17, 1894 to ensure that the entire community knew that Peter was in the final process of officially acquiring the land under the under the Homestead Act of 1862. On October 15, 1895, Peter submitted proof to the land office in New Orleans that he had complied with the homesteader\u2019s rules for settlers.  Although, Peter was able to give his final testimony, he almost missed his final filing date because he had a difficult time raising money to pay for his transportation to New Orleans and other expenses. He pleaded his case as documented in his land entry file #9590 as follows:  Land Office New Orleans, Louisiana \u201cBefore me the undersigned authority, personally came and appeared Peter Clark who being by me first duty sworn, deposes and says that he is the identical person who made Homestead Entry No 9590 on April 25, 1887; that the seven years in which homesteaders are required to make Proof in support of their entries expired in his case on April 25, 1894 and his final Proof made this day in support of his said Entry #9590 is not within the statutory period. That he is a very poor man and that until today he has not been able to get money to pay the cost of making proof and this is the earliest day he had the money. That he has lived on and cultivated his land in good faith for over ten (10) years and it would work a great hardship, were he deprived of his entry. Wherefore, he prays that his Proof be accepted passed, his Final Certificate Receipt issue thereon and that he may receive Patent on his said entry after the necessary formalities in the provisos- Sworn to and subscribed Peter x Clarkhis MarkBefore me A.D., 1894 G.McD Brumby \u2013 Register\u201d   After pleading his case, Peter Clark received his Homestead Land patent in 1896 and he resided on this land until his death in 1909.

She married Theodore Minthorn in 1842 and they lived in a Quaker community in Ontario where they began raising their family of seven children: Anna, Ellen, Henry John, Hulda, Agnes, Phoebe and Pennington. In 1859 the Minthorns emigrated to Iowa and settled on \u201cLone Tree Farm\u201d southeast of West Branch. Mary Minthorn taught her husband how to read and write. Her community knew her as an expert weaver \u2013 a skill she used to support herself and her family. Theodore Minthorn died in 1866 and Mary moved to another home nearer town. Later, Mary moved to the western Iowa town of Kingsley to be near two of her daughters and their families. Her daughter Hulda and children visited their grandmother at her home there.\u00a0 After Hulda died in 1884, all three of the Hoover children were sent to live with Grandmother Minthorn while the family decided what should happen to them. In the end, Grandmother Minthorn raised her namesake granddaughter herself, while the boys went to live with the families of different uncles. In 1889, Grandmother Minthorn and May moved from Kingsley to Newberg, Oregon to be near the Henry John Minthorn family, where Bert had gone to live in 1885. Grandmother Minthorn lived to see all three of the Hoover children attend college and get married. She died in 1903 and is buried in the Newberg Cemetery.

                "bodyText": "As Tulelake receded in 1917, farm units for homesteading were made available after World War Two. The last groups of homesteaders were drawn in lotteries from 1946 to 1949.  The pickle jar became the choice for homestead lotteries after the fish bowl became too small. The 1946 drawing held at the armory in Klamath Falls included one thousand three hundred and five names typed on the slips of paper, put into capsules and placed into this three gallon pickle jar. Only 86 names were drawn.  This pickle jar was filled for the last time in 1949 in the American Legion Hall in Tulelake. Eighty six out of five thousand names were drawn.  With these drawings they had to have drawings for them because there were so many more applications than there was plots of land available. In the halls was always full. There is always there full of people who are sitting in a desk, people, a lot of them on the edge of the seat, hoping that their name would be the next one drawn out. But the ones that were there, why, they let out a good yell. The tension was there and everybody was just waiting to because they knew it was an opportunity there. They were getting an opportunity for new life in a new community. And it was really something to see.  When we got down there where we had guys that came next to us were navy. 'Course we were all army men, two Navy.  The morning at the we went to move out on our site, when it snowd, and when I got out there close to it, I put the car in second gear and opened it wide open and headed out. And when I hit the yellow post-it, mark my land the phone to the right of it out on the land, And where it got stuck, that was home.  We spent some time in the tent. The wind blew and mercifully that spring and that poor old tent, what kind of rock and it wasn't real, real comfortable. The dirt came in, of course, and we had our grain stored, our seed grain stored in the tent so it wouldn't get wet.  Move on to the Korean War display.  Members of our community served under the command of General MacArthur to help protect South Korea from conquest by North Korea, when war broke out in 1950.  When I got to Korea, they put us in some high walled camps for a while. Then they were building the Quonset hut barracks after a fashion. We were being woken up at night, sometimes with the small aircraft flying over the runway, dropping hand grenades, which they call bed check Charlie. I never did figure out why they didn't go after that guy, but they just let him do it night after night, probably a couple of nights every week.  Between August 5th, 1964, and April 30th, 1975, three point four million military personnel served in the Vietnam War.  The minute that door opened and you started walking towards the tarmac, the heat was just beyond anything, I'd and I'm a Phenix, Arizona boy, and this was a heat like I've never experienced, the humidity was up 105 percent, was probably 108 degrees, and it was eight o'clock at night.  I think there was one period of over three months that we weren't without any fresh meat or fresh vegetables. A typical breakfast was one spoonful of eggs. What are sort of green dehydrate would have been reconstituted out of powdered eggs at one spoonful of square dehydrated potatoes and possibly two little small Vienna sausages and one piece of bread without any butter or jam.  Rarely ever did you get to see the bad guy because his whole mission in life was to just Pick at you and run. They said we lost the war. We didn't lose the war. We fought it the best way we could. We were just as proud and dedicated to our own brothers as they were. We were just dealt a different kind of card.  The official end of America's direct involvement in Vietnam was April 30th, 1975.  Step over to the farming and ranching display.  Just as the United States is a melting pot of people from all parts of the world, so is this region. Sharing of education's travel experiences, agricultural knowledge and skills have created these diverse communities.\u00a0 Where have you found Nettles growing? You knew it was the finest soil. And as you know, we have lots of wild metals in this country, and it was also an indicator of water.  I had my first job when I was seven and Ray was nine. We delivered papers in the morning and milk in the afternoon and we got along fine. But I always wanted to ever do was be a cowboy.  The tractors gradually came in and replaced the horses in our area has a beautiful soil. Some of the best soil actually in the world.  You should now be standing in front of our current issues.

                "bodyText": "Around the time of Mexican independence from Spain in 1821, soldiers of the Presidio of San Diego began building their homes outside the adobe walls of this fortified settlement. One the finest example of these homes is the Estudillo House, a National Historic Landmark located in the Old Town San Diego State Historic Park. Built between 1827 and 1829, the Estudillo House, or the La Casa de Estudillo, is one of the oldest surviving examples of a typical large Spanish-Mexican one-story town house in California. Since its construction, the house has served as a residence, a town hall, a chapel, a shelter, an early 20th-century tourist attraction, and a museum.  Construction of the house began in 1827 on a land parcel that overlooked the Old Town San Diego plaza and under the direction of Captain Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda de Estudillo, a commander of the San Diego Presidio. The great U-shaped one story house is built around three sides of a large patio and originally contained 13 rooms set in a straight line. The rooms are connected only by an external veranda. The adobe walls, averaging three to five feet in thickness, are coated with white plaster and gave protection in heat and cold. Originally a small round wooden cupola, used by the family and guests to watch the bullfights and festivals in the plaza, topped the house. When Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda de Estudillo died in 1830, the house passed to his son, Jos\u00e9 Antonio Estudillo and his son\u2019s wife, Mar\u00eda Victoria Dominguez de Estudillo. \u00a0 The house was to become the social center of life in Old Town San Diego. The building was so central to town life that, from the early 1830s to 1856, a large hall in the house served as the town chapel and as a school. Jos\u00e9 Antonio and Mar\u00eda Victoria fostered within the Estudillo House an atmosphere of social, political, and community involvement in what was considered at the time to be one of the finest houses in Mexican California. \u00a0 Both Jos\u00e9 Antonio and his wife Mar\u00eda Victoria were active and influential members in their community. By 1829, Jos\u00e9 Antonio owned three ranches in California, and as his wealth grew, so did his importance in the community. From 1828 until his death in 1852, Jos\u00e9 Antonio held many public offices in San Diego. He served as revenue collector, treasurer, mayor, justice of the peace, judge of San Diego under Mexican rule, and later as treasurer and assessor of San Diego County under American rule. While Jos\u00e9 Antonio played an active role in the development of early San Diego, his wife fully participated in the life of the Mexican pueblo and the new American city. Mar\u00eda Victoria lived in the Estudillo House for over 40 years until her death in 1873. Known for her charm, compassion, and hospitality, Mar\u00eda Victoria and Jos\u00e9 Antonio entertained some of the most brilliant and aristocratic citizens of Upper California in the Estudillo House. During the Mexican-American War, instead of joining her husband at one of their homes in El Cajon, Mar\u00eda Victoria remained in San Diego. While the \u201cCalifornians\u201d held the area, Mar\u00eda Victoria gave courage and spirit to the women and children of San Diego providing them with refuge behind the thick walls of the house. In the early 1850\u2019s, when peace had returned to California after the war, unexpected deaths in the Estudillo family left nine children orphaned. Mar\u00eda Victoria immediately welcomed these children into her home, and she bore the responsibility of raising this new family alone for Jos\u00e9 Antonio passed away shortly after in 1852. For the next 21 years, Mar\u00eda Victoria continued to live in the Estudillo House, raising her new family, taking care of the sick, and performing acts of charity where she could. The Estudillo House remained in the Estudillo family until 1887, when family descendants moved to Los Angeles and left the home with a caretaker. Around this time the house gained prominence through its association with Helen Hunt Jackson's popular 1884 novel\u00a0Ramona. Set in Southern California, the novel painted a romanticized portrait of Mexican colonial life, and it effectively generated a nationwide interest in the region. Publication of\u00a0Ramona\u00a0coincided with the opening of railroad lines to the region. This provided interested tourists with the means of transportation to see the locations discussed in the novel. While the novel was a work of fiction, tourists flocked to the Estudillo House nonetheless, because they believed it was likely the location of Ramona\u2019s (the beautiful half-Spanish and half-Indian heroine) marriage. The Estudillo House became known as \u201cRamona\u2019s Marriage Place\u201d and was converted into a commercial venture. Due in part to tourist vandalism and the caretaker selling off pieces of the house as\u00a0Ramona-related relics, the house sat nearly in ruins by 1906. Nat R. Titus purchased the worn-down house and sold it a year later to the San Diego Electric Railway Company, owned by sugar magnate John D. Spreckles. In 1910, Spreckles financed its restoration under the supervision of Architect Hazel Waterman. Restored to a condition closely related to descriptions in the novel, the Estudillo House remained a\u00a0Ramona-related tourist attraction for many years to come. On one day in 1940, \u201cRamona\u2019s Marriage Place drew 1,632 visitors.  Donated to the State by Mr. Legler Benbough in 1968, the house became part of the California State Park System. Restored as a house museum identified with the Estudillo family, the museum now features furnished rooms, including a living room, master bedroom, child\u2019s bedroom, workroom, dining room, chapel, a working kitchen, and a large courtyard. Through self-guided or docent lead tours of the Estudillo House and the many other historic sites throughout the Old Town San Diego Historic Park, visitors can experience the transformation of San Diego from a Mexican\u00a0pueblo\u00a0to an American settlement.  Estudillo House (La Casa de Estudillo), a National Historic Landmark,\u00a0is located at 4000 Mason St., San Diego, CA.",

As the crust is stretched (pulled apart), high angle faults develop. Along these faults, mountains uplift and valleys drop, creating the distinctive mountain ranges and wide valleys of theBasin and Range province.\u00a0\u00a0  As rocky ranges rise, the newly exposed rock is immediately\u00a0subjected to weathering and erosion. This rock is attacked by water, ice, wind, and other erosive agents, that have produced many of the geologic features visible today.\u00a0\u00a0  The majority of outcrops at City of Rocks, and all of the pinnacles, consist of intrusive igneous rock with a granitic composition. Geologists have mapped the two different types of granitic rock within the Reserve as the Green Creek Complex and the Almo pluton.\u00a0\u00a0",

Getty hoped that a stand here would encourage stragglers from the 6th, 19th, and 8th Corps to rejoin the fight. Getty repulsed Early\u2019s first attempt to break his line with a withering volley. Getty\u2019s line held off a second assault and remained in command of the hill. Frustrated, Early amassed all his artillery, nearly 30 cannon and bombarded the hill for half an hour. When the smoke cleared, the Confederate offensive resumed. Despite his troops\u2019 stiff resistance, Getty ordered a withdrawal northwest of Middletown to rejoin the broken Army of the Shenandoah. Early\u2019s Confederates proudly marched through the streets of Middletown.",

With a gabled slate roof, segmental arched openings,\u00a0and louver blinds, the building is considered one of the best surviving examples of the American Cavalry Caserne Style.\u00a0\u00a0  Building 19 had multiple\u00a0purposes including stabling horses\u00a0and\u00a0housing an x-ray lab and cryptography unit for sending and receiving coded messages, but its main purpose was\u00a0storage of lumber.\u00a0 \u00a0 Making gunstocks\u00a0was a tedious process that required the wood be air dry for 2-8 years,\u00a0until it reached the proper moisture level,\u00a0to ensure that when they were carved or worked on the lathes the wood wouldn\u2019t crack or warp. At the Armory the primary wood used to make gunstock blanks was Black Walnut as it is a hard, dense wood that is resilient and when it is seasoned (dried) it doesn\u2019t shrink much and isn\u2019t prone to splitting. Because of the length of time necessary to season the wood, thousands of blanks needed to be properly stored for drying at a single time.\u00a0At full capacity Building 19 could hold up to six hundred thousand gunstocks.\u00a0\u00a0  As warfare\u00a0and the\u00a0manufacturing\u00a0of\u00a0arms changed, research labs, workshops, garages, machine shops, engineer branch, and housing for mechanical systems were added.\u00a0\u00a0  Built in four separate phases, the Long Storehouse I, Long Storehouse II, Stables, and West Addition were added as the need for storage increased. After each addition the name of the building changed to represent the new purpose and design. Names included \u201cBrick Timber Store House,\u201d \u201cNew Store House,\u201d and \u201cGun Stock House.\u201d\u00a0By early winter of 1863 construction was completed bringing Building 19 to its current length of 764 feet.\u00a0  When the Armory closed in 1968, the building remained vacant until Springfield Technical Community College\u00a0(STCC)\u00a0took over the building and used it for storage. Between 1981-1983 the Springfield Police stabled their mounted unit in the building. In 2018 the building was renovated\u00a0into a student center in 2018\u00a0the STCC.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Today while the building serves a different purpose, one can still hear the individuals milling about and experience the beauty of a building that was essential to the operation of Springfield Armory.\u00a0\u00a0",

The rustic cabins and family-style dining are a favorite of families and anglers alike, and the front porch rocking chairs give guests an opportunity to rock their stress to sleep and awaken their \u201cOld West spirit.\u201d A large corral operation offers horseback trail rides, stagecoach adventures, and a popular cookout. This reservable lodging facility is operated by a park partner. Campsites to Lodges Indians, fur trappers, and explorers on the Bannock Trail camped in this area where a sagebrush meadow was encircled by Douglas fir, quaking aspen, and a mountain stream tumbled toward the Yellowstone River. President Chester Arthur camped here in 1883. In 1906, the Wylie Permanent Camping Company built a tent camp that became known as \"Camp Roosevelt,\" though Theodore Roosevelt never camped there. The tents were replaced by a lodge and cabins in the 1920s. Park lodges and cabins were built to accommodate the increasing number of visitors arriving in their own automobiles who wanted something more than a tent, but less expensive and formal than the park's hotels. During the 1920s and 1930s, the old hotels often stood empty while the new lodges overflowed with visitors. Dudes & Scientists Camp Roosevelt provided the atmosphere of a dude ranch and was a base for fishing parties and saddle-horse trips. It also served as a field laboratory where teachers and their students could conduct research at minimum expense, a purpose that the first director of the National Park Service was promoting for the parks. In what was a forerunner to the educational programs found in the parks today, the National Park Service hired a naturalist at Grinnell College to present lectures and conduct daily field trips for Camp Roosevelt visitors and collect botanical specimens for the park museum. Scientists based near conducted studies on the park's wildlife. From 1921 to 1923, the lodge was the headquarters for a boy's summer camp run by Alvin Whitney of the New York State School of Forestry at Syracuse University. National Historic District The Roosevelt Lodge Historic District, which includes 130 buildings, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983, with a period of significance from 1906 to 1948. The lodge, constructed of un-peeled logs and completed in 1920, was originally surrounded by 43 small log cabins, the first of which were completed in 1922. Over the years, the Roosevelt Lodge area became a repository for guest cabins brought from areas in the park where they were no longer wanted. By 1982, the corral had been moved farther from the cabins, of which there were now 110 of four main types. The area has undergone intermittent expansion and changes as visitor use has changed and facilities have aged over the years. The architectural appearance of the original lodge is retained only in the interior and exterior of the front portion (the lounge and dining room); the other sections of the building have been modified. The accommodations are still rustic, with unpaved roads into and around the lodge and cabins. Although the Grand Loop Road can be seen from the corral, which is not part of the historic district, it is obscured from view of the lodge and most of the cabins by a stand of mature trees.

Look for them along the nature trail.\" \"No bicycles. No horses. No pets. Never approach wildlife. Do not collect or disturb natural features.\" Below this is a title reading \"Collapse\" next to a black and white photo of a person standing above a collapsed area of ground. Text reads: \"Many geologic processes happen slowly over hundreds, thousands, or millions of years. But some, like coal vein fires, happen right before our eyes.\" \"Park visitors came to this spot to watch an underground coal fire that burned from 1951 to 1977. Some days there was only a wisp of smoke. Other days change was rapid. Red-hot rock glowed at the bottom of deep crevasses. Plants withered on the hot ground. Hillsides crumbled. The land gave way.\" End of description.",

Springfield Armory was established as a Federal Armory in 1794 under George Washington.\u00a0  As Springfield Armory underwent the transition from an Arsenal to an Armory after the American Revolution, the Armory began expanding as it was no long just storing firearms, but manufacturing them. Additional buildings were added to the Hill Shops, the Water Shops were built and development occurred at Federal Square to aid in the production of firearms.\u00a0  Constructed between 1847-1850 under Major James W. Ripley, the Main Arsenal faced scrutiny during its construction; it\u00a0cost $86,066 to build the Arsenal. \u00a0It was built to be centered between the Paymasters Residence and the Master Armorer's Residence, making it just askew from the walkway to the Administration building across the Green. Ripley would plant trees to make it less obvious. The Main Arsenal was built to reflect the power of the United States Military and it expressed an authoritarian and practical nature ensuring the building would command the Green and the Armory complex, as it does today.\u00a0  The Main Arsenal, with its expansive interior, was used to store firearms. A unique feature of the clock tower is the self-supported spiral staircase that goes up six floors to the base of the flagpole. The staircase has no central support column, but rather the supports for the staircase are built into the walls. \u00a0Before automobiles, the main entrance allowed for horse-drawn carriages to drive through the tower where Armory workers would load and unload firearms. In 1941 the wood doors were shortened when a loading dock was added to allow delivery by trucks.\u00a0  In 1960 the Main Arsenal was designated as a contributing building to the Springfield Armory Historical Landmark and in October 1974 it became a part of the National Park Service as Springfield Armory National Historic Site. Today the Main Arsenal serves as a museum which tells the story of the workers, technological innovation, the evolution of firearms, and the impact the Armory had on Springfield, the surrounding communities, and the United States.\u00a0  \u00a0In 1852, when Springfield became a city, the Armory was incorporated into the city seal. While the City has built up around the Armory, the impact and significance of the Armory remains firmly rooted, which can be seen by gazing upon the Main Arsenal as it sits atop the hill overlooking the City of Springfield.\u00a0",

As the coal fire burned deep into the hillside, cracks in the rock layers allowed air to be sucked down into the fire. Fire burned up the cracks and baked the rocks nearby, forming vertical \"chimneys.\" Chimneys are the hottest part of the coal fire and bake the rock inside into a very hard clinker called porcellanite which is especially resistant to erosion.  This chimney you are looking at was exposed when softer sediments around it eroded away.\u00a0 There are many signs that large coal vein fires have burned throughout the park in the past. Even today, coal fires can sometimes be found shaping and changing the landscape of the badlands.  Geology is not only a study of the past; it is an ongoing process.",

Fed by meltwater from the glacier above, the river carries boulders, gravel, and fine sediment downstream. When the water flow is not strong enough to move these sedimaents, the river deposits them on the floor of the streambed. As the deposits build up, the river bottom rises, creating bars. The bars divert the river's channel and the river winds, \"braiding\" across its bed. Because of their dynamic nature, braided rivers often flood or wash out bridges and roads.  Secondary Text Geohazard Warning: Without warning debris flows and glacial outburst floods can occur at any time, eroding stream banks and scouring everything in its path, including rocks and trees. If an earthquake occurs or you hear a prolonged rumbling, move quickly uphill, away from rivers and streams.  Wayside Panel Description A single photo of a wide, rocky river bed with a muddy river braiding around gravel bars fills the wayside panel. The wayside text forms a column in the left third of the panel. On the right towards the top of the panel, a second smaller photo overlaps the background photo. The smaller photo is an aerial view of a long, narrow glacier curving through a valley.

Built in 1918, the lodge mirrored the Paradise Inn's rustic design, with a steeply pitched roof for shedding snow and shingle siding with log facade. It overlooked the Paradise Valley and the Tatoosh Range\u00a0and provided a commanding view of Mount Rainier.\u00a0  Services offered here were an economical alternative to meals and accommodations at the nearby Paradise Inn. The lodge was demolished in the mid-1950's to make way for additional parking.\u00a0  In 2006, prior to construction of the visitor center, archeologists explored this site for remains of the lodge. Along with sections of the original building's foundation they found flooring and structural basement components, plus articles left behind by early visitors and employees including ski pole baskets, glass, dinnerware, a partially full whiskey bottle, and other personal items.\u00a0  Secondary Text Marking History: Four pieces of the original foundation mark the corners of the lodge in the landscaping before you. On either side of you, in the plaza surface, rock continues the outline with the remaining outline buried beneath the visitor center behind you.\u00a0  Wayside Panel Description The whole wayside panel is filled with a single historic, sepia-tinted photo of the Paradise Camp Lodge.

                "bodyText": "The Hopi pueblo of Awatovi was already over 300 years old when Spanish explorers arrived there in 1540. Led by Francisco V\u00e1zquez de Coronado, the Spanish were searching for the legendary golden cities with hopes of bringing wealth back to Spain. What they found instead was a harsh, arid country dotted with native towns, a region isolated from the populated Rio Grande Valley. The first of the Hopi settlements the Spanish came across in Arizona was the Awatovi pueblo. Years later, the Spanish returned to Awatovi to establish a mission. Today, the Awatovi Ruins in Keams Canyon is a National Historic Landmark on the Hopi Indian Reservation in northeastern Arizona. The Coronado expedition left Mexico in 1540 and headed north with a company of over 300 Spaniards, 1,300 Mexicans, and both Native and African slaves. As they trekked through the desert, Coronado ordered one of his men, Pedro de Tovar, to lead a party of seventeen horsemen and several footmen in search of seven Hopi villages. Awatovi was the first of these villages Tovar and his men discovered. Upon contact, the Hopi and Spanish briefly skirmished, and then exchanged gifts before the de Tovar party moved on. The arrival of Coronado\u2019s men in Awatovi marked the first exchange the Spanish had with the Hopi in Arizona. Afterward, contact between the Spanish and the Hopi was sporadic over the next 90 years, until Spain began to establish missions in the region to create a permanent European presence. The Hopi had no food surplus or wealth of gold or silver treasure, and their land was not a strategic place to establish a military presence, so the Spanish had no interest in living among the Hopi for any reason other than religious conversion. During the Spanish colonial period, Jesuit and Franciscan missionaries brought Catholic and European values to North America on behalf of the Spanish crown. The Roman Catholic Church was charged with spreading Catholicism. The missionaries founded parishes near American Indian villages where they could make Christian converts, attempt to control the culture, and help administer Spanish law. In 1629, the year Spain launched large-scale missionary efforts in the Southwest, Franciscans founded a mission church at Awatovi. The Franciscan fathers at Awatovi named their mission church San Bernard de Aguatubi, after Saint Bernard of Clairvaux. According to the records of a New Mexico missionary, the Franciscans at Awatovi struggled to persuade the Hopi to convert until a miracle occurred. The Hopi brought a blind boy to Father Francisco Porras and asked the father to heal him. The legend goes that Porras held his cross to the boy\u2019s eyes curing his blindness. Afterward, a large portion of the Hopi at Awatovi converted, but others mistrusted the Catholic fathers and worried that they would not be able to keep their own essential rituals. During the 17th century, Awatovi hosted the largest mission of any Hopi pueblos and was home to a population of roughly 900 Christian Hopi in 1664. In addition to Catholicism, the Franciscans brought European tools, domesticated animals, new agriculture, and trade opportunities to their southwestern missions. At Awatovi, the fathers gave the Hopi iron knives, axes, mattocks, picks, crowbars, saws, and chisels as well as knowledge of Spanish wood and stone-working techniques. The Hopi also adopted animal husbandry. They acquired and began raising sheep, which provided a new source of protein and wool for making textiles. The Spanish introduced new crops, including peaches and wheat, which the Hopi incorporated into their diet. The Hopi territory also became part of a trade route that a wagon train traveled through three times a year. This wagon train gave the Hopi at Awatovi access to goods from Mexico, Europe, and Asia. The residents of Awatovi were an anomaly among the Hopi, and the town\u2019s open acceptance of Christianity led to its destruction. Beyond Awatovi, other Hopi villages rejected Spanish culture and Catholicism. Only four missionary outposts existed in the Hopi province beyond Awatovi and they did not have Catholic fathers in residence. The Awatovi Hopi built their new church on top of their kivas, adobe structures Puebloans used in spiritual rituals. Despite the apparent abandonment of pre-contact religious practice, some native residents at Awatovi resisted the missionaries. A Hopi traditionalist poisoned one of the Awatovi mission\u2019s founding fathers in 1633. During the Pueblo Revolt of 1680, the Hopi killed the fathers and razed the church at Awatovi. Even so, when the Spanish returned to take back Awatovi in 1692, the Hopi welcomed them and invited them to reestablish the mission. Despite the instances of resistance on the inside, the anti-Spanish Hopi sacked the pueblo in 1701. These Hopi wanted to purge their province of Christianity and the Hopi who accepted it to ensure the survival of their own religious practices. They completely destroyed the pueblo and killed all the men at Awatovi during the attack sparing only the unbaptized women and children who had knowledge of Hopi rituals and songs. The survivors were separated and sent to the surrounding Hopi villages. In retaliation, the Spanish attacked the Hopi several times over the decade following the destruction of Awatovi, but were unsuccessful in reclaiming the Hopi province. Since Awatovi, the Hopi have not hosted a Roman Catholic church or parish on their land. In the 20th century, Awatovi proved to be a valuable archeological resource. During the 1930s, a group of experts from Harvard University carried out the first multidisciplinary study in American archeology at the ruin. Involved in the field study were geologists, surveyors, cartographers, photographers, bone and ceramics experts, artists, and ethno biologists. They excavated over 1,300 rooms, discovered 11,700 stone and bone artifacts, and catalogued 8,500 pottery specimens in addition to recording over half a million potsherds. They also identified three Franciscan churches, two of which were over 100 feet long. In order to preserve Awatovi Ruins for future research and enjoyment, the site is not open to the public. Awatovi Ruins, a\u00a0National Historic Landmark, is located south of Keams Canyon on the Hopi Indian Reservation in northeastern AZ. Awatovi Ruins is closed to the public. The Hopi Reservation welcomes visitors. For more information, visit the\u00a0Hopi Tribe\u00a0or the\u00a0Hopi Cultural Center\u00a0websites.",

Their redoubts so low, the cannon's mouth nearly on the ground, and at every discharge a blaze of fire sprang out among the dry leaves, which were soon ablaze and eating their way toward the gully, which was full of a mass of human beings, squirming around... Ah, but little can a peaceful citizen imagine the horror of war...At this stage our colonel, Will H. Martin, sang out, \"'Boys, this is butchery,\"' and, mounting our head logs, with a white hankerchief, he sang out to the Yanks as well as to our own men, \"'Cease firing and help get out those men.\"' Col. Martin's actions would save the lives of many Union soldiers in that incident. In a show of respect for this act of humanity, one of the Union officers would present Col.

The limestone bluff in front of you first appeared on a 1732 French map as pierre a fleche, which means the \u201crock of arrows.\u201d As a landmark on the river, it guided westward travel by water and wagon for trade and settlement.   \u201cOur company crossed the Missouri near the Arrow Rock Ferry on the first day of September 1821\u2026\u201d -William Becknell   The Arrow Rock is part of the Santa Fe Trail story. When William Becknell\u2019s party crossed the river here in 1821 heading west to trade, a new era in American history began. For some, the trail brought wealth and opportunity. For others, the trail caused loss of life, land, culture, and resources.  Today, the river no longer flows in front of the bluff. Use this painting to imagine a completely different scene with the hustle and bustle of a riverport and town. Site Information\u00a0 The Arrow Rock Ferry Landing was put on the list of the National Register of Historic Places on May 1, 2013, and Rich Lawson, who owns the property with his wife, Debbie, is looking to add more richness to Arrow Rock's history.

In August 1902, the International Harvester Company (IHC) was formed by the merger of McCormick and four other harvester manufacturing concerns. The building was constructed in 1902 as one of the final acts of the company and is one of the earliest assets of the newly formed combination. The Pittsburgh Branch House is significant for its innovation in commerce and agriculture sales as well as its identifiable architecture features. The Pittsburgh Branch House is an example of the Classical Revival style that was widely used to convey International Harvester\u2019s brand and success. In the first decades of the twentieth century, IHC embarked on an intensive campaign for national expansion. The addition to the building and its overall reconfiguration in 1913 is a representative of this effort. The company\u2019s national campaign was successful, and the Pittsburgh Branch House was ranked among the top IHC branches in the country.",

Located in Solomons, where the Patuxent River joins the Chesapeake, the museum is a focal point for the many visitors coming to the area. Exhibits tell the story of the region's fascinating past and present. Fossils from millions of years ago show how a shallow ocean once covered what is now the Chesapeake Bay. Other exhibits depict human life along the Patuxent from the seventeenth-century to the present with over five hundred artifacts and photographs, including a twenty-eight-foot three-log canoe, a tobacco press, and boats from Solomons shipyards. Fifteen aquariums, from 50 to 3,500 gallons, explore the aquatic life of the Chesapeake estuary, displaying plants and animals from the salty waters of the Bay, and the fresh water of the upper Patuxent River.\u00a0The museum exhibition building includes three permanent exhibits focusing on these themes: Miocene era fossils, a 13-tank aquarium that shows marine life from the Patuxent River and Chesapeake Bay, and a maritime collection that includes two lighthouses and a 113-year-old bugeye that takes visitors out on the Patuxent River. The museum also includes an oyster house, small craft shed, and carving shed.",

You are free to ascend South Bluff or roam on foot through this area on either side of Mitchell Pass; however, no fires or overnight camps are permitted. Rough clothing and stout footgear are recommended. Because there are no trails, it is suggested that you let the Park Rangers in the Visitor Center know when you are climbing South Bluff.

South Bluff rises above the flat prairie in geologic strata of sandstone, siltstone, volcanic ash and limestone. This area is unimproved and there are no improvements planned. Of the five notable rocks within the monument, South Bluff features three: Dome Rock, Crown Rock, and Sentinel Rock. At the western end of South Bluff is Mitchell Pass. This pass is formed with Sentinel Rock on the south side of the pass and Eagle Rock on the north. The eastern end of South Bluff gradually lowers in elevation, forming isolated prominences of which Dome Rock is the largest. The western end remains at a significant elevation above the prairie. Between Sentinel Rock and Crown Rock is a \u201cgap\u201d referred to as Coyote Pass. Coyote Pass is 4,331 feet above sea level. South Bluff geology is similar to Scotts Bluff (to the north) and also has similar vegetation.",

A winter wonderland, Paradise offers a plethera of winter recreational opportunities, for people of all ages.

An abundance of snow creates a winter recreation paradise, but also brings the challenges of icy, snowy roads, and unpredictable weather. The road to Paradise is plowed when possible to allow access. Spend hours at Paradise or add a stop in Longmire to make a full day of winter fun.  If winter recreation is your passion, look no further than Paradise. Everyone is welcome to explore this winter wonderland that has activities for all ages. As the colors of the mountain change from fall to winter, winter photography gets icy as the mountain is draped in snow. Once the snow is deep enough, crosscountry skiing, snowshoeing, snowboarding, and winter\u00a0camping are adventures that can start from the edge of the Paradise parking lot. Whether you want to cruise down the mountain, take a slow stroll to capture winter photography, stay for a few hours or stay overnight, Paradise at Mount Rainier has something for you!\u00a0  The Paradise sledding and sliding area is perfect for a family of all ages. The sledding area is located north of the upper parking lot.\u00a0While beautiful, the greater Paradise area contains avalanche zones, unstable snow bridges and deceptively steep drop offs where sledding activities are unsafe.\u00a0The official Paradise Sledding Area is the safest and\u00a0only\u00a0location that sledding is permitted\u00a0in Mount Rainier National Park. The sledding area at Paradise is\u00a0generally open late December through mid-March, depending on snow.\u00a0Sledding runs are only opened when there\u2019s sufficient snow depth to prevent resource damage.\u00a0Use only inner tubes, plastic sleds, saucers, or other soft sliding devices. No wooden toboggans, runner sleds with metal edges, or other hard devices are permitted.\u00a0Dress warmly in layers with wicking fabric.\u00a0NOTE: The sledding\u00a0area has NOT yet opened for the season (updated 11/23/21).  When you need to warm up head to the Jackson Visitor Center\u00a0(access may be limited due to COVID-19 safety precautions)\u00a0to check out the exhibits, watch the park film, or talk to a ranger. At the visitor center get information about trail conditions and permits to make sure you have what you need for your winter adventure.\u00a0  Check Road Status or for the most updated road information check @MountRainierNPS on\u00a0Twitter, no account necessary. Avalanche Alert:\u00a0Before starting out for the day, check the weather forecast and determine the avalanche hazard. Snow avalanches are common in winter and spring. The greatest danger to you is an avalanche that you trigger by skiing, snowboarding, snowshoeing, or climbing in avalanche terrain. Consider snowpack, weather, and topography in selecting your route. Ask yourself, \u201cWill this slope slide?\u201d and if it does, \u201cWhere will I or my partner go?\u201d Even small avalanches can be deadly.  Pack accordingly:\u00a0Carry an avalanche transceiver, probe, shovel and these 10 essentials.",

Each year thousands of people successfully climb this 14,410-foot active volcano. There is access to over twenty different climbing routes and ski descents via four main trailheads to approach the mountain: Paradise, Westside Road, White River, and Mowich Lake.  Reaching the summit via any route requires a vertical elevation gain of more than 9,000 feet and traveling over ten miles in distance. Climbers must be in excellent physical condition and well prepared. Technical glacier-travel rope skills are also required to ascend and descend the mountain safely. Either independently or with a guide, climbing and skiing on Mount Rainier offers an unparalleled experience within the Pacific Northwest's Cascade Mountain Range.\u00a0 COVID-19 Last Updated: October 27, 2021. Restrictions inside the park are in place due to COVID-19. See the park's COVID-19 Visitor Guide for more details. Changes affecting climbers include:  The Public Shelter at Camp Muir is CLOSED for visitor use and is for emergency-use only. Plan on staying in tents at Camp Muir. Search and rescue response may be delayed due to restrictions and precautions our rangers are taking to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Please stay home if you feel sick or are feeling any COVID-19 related symptoms. Maintain proper physical distancing between yourself and other climbing parties on the mountain.\u00a0  Fees, Permits, and Reservations Two things are required to climb Mount Rainier:  Each individual must pay the\u00a0Annual Climbing Fee each year (good for the entire calendar year).

While the Annual Climbing Fee only needs to be purchased once for the entire calendar year, a Climbing Permit is specific to the date range and party to which it is issued.  \"Single-push\" climbers and skiers are required to obtain a Climbing Permit.  A climber must be at least 18 years old to climb Mount Rainier. Anyone younger than 18 years of age must have the permission of a parent or legal guardian at the time of registration.  About Reservations: Reservations for Climbing Permits can be made through the Recreation.gov website for Mount Rainier National Park Wilderness and Climbing Permits. Reservations are encouraged but not required, especially for people traveling long distances to get to the park, larger climbing parties, and those trying to climb over a holiday weekend. Only during high-use months (June through September) are reservations for Climbing Permits made available. Reservations must be made at least two days in advance of the trip start.  Only approximately 60% of the total Climbing Permits are available for reservation. The remaining permits are only issued at the ranger stations inside the park on a first-come, first-served basis.  About Solo Climbing: To climb or ski Mount Rainier without a partner requires a Solo Climbing Permit. All soloists must apply for the permit via the Solo Application Form. Note: all climbers, including approved soloists, must still pay the Annual Climbing Fee and obtain a Climbing Permit for each trip.\u00a0 Weather and Conditions Weather, snow, and route conditions can change rapidly, making the difference between a pleasant and rewarding experience or a tragedy. Before beginning a climb, obtain a current weather forecast. Rangers at both Camp Muir and Camp Schurman can give out updated forecasts before your summit attempt, but look for a general trend in the weather before arriving at the park.  During your climb, turn back if weather conditions deteriorate. Severe winter-like storms on the mountain are not uncommon during the summer. Poor weather often contributes to accidents and near-misses on the mountain. Here are some links to weather and avalanche resources for Mount Rainier National Park. For recent route conditions updates check out the Mount Rainier Climbing Blog. Guide Services Climbing instruction, multi-day summit climbs, multi-day climbing seminars, and private climbs are available through:  Alpine Ascents International International Mountain Guides, LLC Rainier Mountaineering, Inc.  There are also 15 single-trip guide services authorized to perform only one guided trip per year. Check the\u00a0list of current Commercial Use Authorizations for approved guide service companies.  Some guided climbs qualify as charities. This type of climb is allowed, but requires a Commercial Use Authorization. Paying the climbing fee is still required.  Engaging in any business in park areas except in accordance with the provisions of a permit, contract, or other written agreement is prohibited. Leading or participating in an unauthorized guided climb of Mount Rainier is illegal (Title 36, Code of Federal Regulations). Learn more about regulations for guiding on Mount Rainier.\u00a0 Route Briefs Route briefs are official in-depth descriptions of climbing routes on Mount Rainier. Use the Route Briefs to familiarize yourself with these four popular routes. Produced by the climbing rangers, they contain the information needed for planning your climb, including route statistics, common pitfalls, and some of the climbing history of the route.

The unpaved 18 mile (29 km) Yampa Bench Road connects the Echo Park Road with the monument's southeast boundary. From there, Moffat County dirt roads lead to US Highway 40. The Yampa Bench Road runs along a large \"bench\" (flat area) above the Yampa River. Several viewpoints, trails, and historic sites provide access to the area's dramatic scenery and history. Wildlife such as mule deer, elk, pronghorn may be occasionally seen. The road is typically impassable in winter.\u00a0  Driving Conditions:\u00a0 The road is winding with some narrow and\u00a0steep sections. A few small stream crossings may hold water and mud for extended periods. The road\u00a0crosses soft sand deposits in several places. In dry conditions, the Yampa Bench Road is considered relatively easy for high-clearance, four-wheel-drive vehicles. The road impassable for all vehicles when wet.  Amenities:\u00a0 There is no food, fuel, restrooms, paved areas, or services along the entire length of the Yampa Bench Road. Cell phone service is not reliable. In the event of an emergency, it could take several hours for help to reach you. Let someone know where you're going and when to expect you back.\u00a0Bring snacks and supplies, and pack out all waste.  Drive carefully! Make sure your vehicle is in good shape and that you drive appropriately for the terrain and road conditions. Visitors caught in the backcountry with disabled vehicles may face towing fees in excess of $1,000. Bring water! There is no potable water along the entire length of the Yampa Bench Road. This is an arid environment. Summer temperatures often exceed 100\u00b0F (38\u00b0C). Bring at least 1 gallon (4 liters) of water per person, per day. Bring more if you'll be active.  Camping is not permitted along the Yampa Bench Road. All vehicles and bikes must remain on roads. The following vehicle types are prohibited: all-terrain vehicles (ATVs),\u00a0off highway vehicles (OHVs), utility terrain vehicles (UTVs), and non-street legal dirt bikes.\u00a0",

Construction started in 1898 by the Carnegies, and the house grew to 22,000\u00a0square feet over the next decade.\u00a0Getting to Plum Orchard can be tricky as it is located halfway up the island, or 7.5 miles from the Sea camp dock.\u00a0\u00a0 It is an estimated roundtrip of 8-10 hours from Sea Camp for those on foot\u00a0(not recommended for day visitors).\u00a0Biking can make this\u00a014-mile round\u00a0trip\u00a0feasible for a day visit to the island.\u00a0If you plan to bike to Plum Orchard, get an early start. Plan on the visit taking\u00a0between 3- 5 hours.\u00a0If you\u2019re on the 11:45 AM ferry, a trip to Plum Orchard is\u00a0not recommended. Water\u00a0is\u00a0available\u00a0at\u00a0Sea Camp and Plum Orchard\u00a0but at no points in between,\u00a0so make sure to bring enough\u00a0for the ride.\u00a0 Bikes are allowed on the Main Road only, which is a sandy road. During dry periods and in the hot summer months, this can be a hard bike ride. The road is not paved, and the sand can be soft in places, especially the Stafford area. Take a break at Stafford to judge\u00a0how you\u2019re feeling.\u00a0Stafford\u00a0is half way to\u00a0Plum Orchard, or one quarter of your\u00a0overall\u00a0trip.\u00a0Keep in mind, once you get to Plum Orchard, you have to get back on your own. There are no rides to or from the house.\u00a0\u00a0 Once at Plum Orchard, treated drinking water is\u00a0available\u00a0from hose faucets on the side of the house. Bathrooms are available around the back of the house and up the stairs on the rear porch.\u00a0Please do not bikes on the grass. Stick to the paths.\u00a0 Tours of the mansion are available daily at 11:00 am, 1:00 pm and 2:00 pm. The tours take about 45 minutes. Wait on the front porch for the docent to begin the tour.\u00a0Tours will be limited to the first floor until the completion of construction. **COVID-19 Update: Plum Orchard Mansion Tours have resumed at Reduced Capacity. Check the Current Conditions page for more details.**\u00a0",

For those hoping to get a close-up look at Dinosaur's geology, Echo Park Road offers a unique perspective. As the road descends, beautiful rock layers tower above historic sites, such as the Chew Ranch and petroglyphs at Pool Creek. At Echo Park Campground, visitors are treated to a spectacular view of Steamboat Rock surrounded by canyons. A short walking trail leads to the confluence of the Green and Yampa Rivers.\u00a0  Driving Conditions:\u00a0 This unpaved road is not suitable for RVs and trailers. High-clearance vehicles and four-wheel-drive (4WD) are strongly recommended. The road is graded, but there are\u00a0several dry wash crossings and a steep descent down a series of switchbacks at the start of the road.  Amenities:\u00a0 Food, fuel, restrooms, and supplies are not available along this road. Cell phone service is not reliable. The primitive Echo Park Campground, located at the end of the 14 mile (23 km) road, offers vault toilets, picnic tables, and potable water when weather allows. Visitors must pack out all trash.",

These are limited to 50 parties for each day, and permits are issued upto 48-hours ahead of time. Tall Trees permits are no longer issued in person at our visitor centers.  This four-mile (6.5km) round trip backcountry hike with a total 1,600 feet (487 m) elevation change is frequently written about in blogs, international publications, and by travel writers. As a result, this trail gets a lot of attention - but this hike is not for the faint of heart - or for people short on time. This is an important time for many visitors to ask themselves, Should I Hike To Hyperion?  Remember to stay on trail.\u00a0  Luckily, there are many other trails in the redwood parks that are easier to access and physically easier to hike. These other trails will also will lead you to equally beautiful old-growth redwood groves.\u00a0If you want our best suggestion for an alternative to the Tall Trees Trail, we suggest the Prairie Creek-Foothill Trail Loop. It is very easy to get to, it has redwoods just as tall, and that loop is much easier on the knees and heart.  The Tall Trees Trail is a moderately strenuous hike that descends 800-feet down to the alluvial floodplain of Redwood Creek. The grove has plenty of water, good soil, and protection from winter winds and as a result has many redwood trees that exceed 350 feet (106 meters) in height.  The grove was featured in a famous 1963 National Geographic Magazine article that helped propel a public push for the creation of Redwood National Park.\u00a0The tallest tree in the world is not located in the Tall Trees Grove.\u00a0After the discovery by the National Geographic survey team, the tree known as the Libby Tree,\u00a0or \"Tall Tree\", held the title until 1994 when the top died back, dropping it down to the 34th tallest tree on the planet.\u00a0  Be Prepared: Make sure you have food, water, sturdy shoes, raingear, and a flashlight.  Access:\u00a0Allow a 1-hour drive (including 7-miles on a dirt road) from the nearest visitor center to the trailhead. The road to the Tall Trees trailhead is a narrow and windy. The small parking lot does not accommodate RVs over 21 feet or vehicles towing trailers. There is a locked gate at the top of the road to manage the traffic and to avoid overcrowding.  We recommend that visitors do not rely on digital maps to find your way to the gate - digital map accuracy and data coveage in our area is poor. Park rangers will provide good directions when you get your free online permit.  Two vault toilets, a shelter, and information and interpretive panels are located at the trailhead.",

Parking:\u00a0Main Parking Lot by Visitor Center. Closest Restroom: Old Point Loma Lighthouse Grounds.  Route:\u00a0This trail follows an old military road that winds down from the top of the park toward San Diego Bay. After reaching the bottom, you return to the trailhead by retracing your steps back up the trail. The trail begins on as an asphalt road and turns off the road onto a dirt and gravel path part way down.\u00a0There is\u00a0no access to the beach at any point on the trail \u00a0 Safety:\u00a0There are no restrooms or water sources along this trail. Hikers should plan to bring water and sun protection, especially during the warm summer months. As in any natural area, there are environmental hazards to watch out for, including toxic plants, animals (such as rattlesnakes), and fragile cliff faces. Bayside Beauty The Bayside Trail\u00a0has great views of the ocean, native wildlife, and\u00a0the city of San Diego. On a clear day you can see the mountains of Mexico to the south, the Laguna mountains to the east behind the San Diego skyline, Naval Air Station North Island, and the Coronado Bridge. Benches and stopping points provide a chance to catch your breath and take in some of the most beautiful views in San Diego county.  Exhibits along the trail explore topics such as native vegetation, animal life, the local climate, World War II history, etc.\u00a0Along the trail you will also encounter a historic searchlight shelter and power plant used during World War\u00a0I and World War\u00a0II. Benches along the trail allow you to rest, reflect, and enjoy the view.\u00a0  The downhill portion of the trail ends at an overlook of\u00a0Ballast Point, where\u00a0Cabrillo\u2019s ships anchored after three months at sea in 1542. Today,\u00a0nuclear-powered submarines are\u00a0docked there, in the same place! Cabrillo\u2019s statue looms on the bluff about 300 feet above this point. Climate, Plants, and Animals The natural environment along the trail is much the same as when Juan Rodriguez Cabrillo came ashore here in 1542. The trail is one of very few places in the world where Coastal Sage Scrub can live. Coastal sage habitat includes plants such as the fragrant black age and sagebrush and is one of the most threatened habitat types in the world. The trail is also home to the Southern Maritime Chaparral, another vulnerable and precious habitat, including cliff spurge, dudleya and barrel cactus.\u00a0Point Loma gets approximately 10 inches of rain a year, so wildlife has adaptated to survive the relatively dry climate.  Hundreds of different native plants and animals call the Coastal Sage Scrub their home. Many local birds, such as the California Quail, American Kestrel, and Morning Dove might be seen along the trail. The Point Loma peninsula is an important stopover for many birds that use the Pacific Flyway. In the spring, migratory birds such as hummingbirds, warblers, wrentits, and bushtits make their appearance. Cottontail rabbits, ground squirrels, lizards, snakes, and foxes might be seen along the trail. During the summer, please keep an eye out for rattlesnakes.

Ground Squirrel\u00a0 Western Gull\u00a0 Anna\u2019s hummingbird\u00a0 Gray Fox   Military History Wayside signs along the Bayside trail highlight the importance of Point Loma and its strategic location in our military history. In 1852, the U.S. Government designated the area as a military reserve. The Army housed a portion of its intricate coastal defense system on Point Loma.  During World Wars I and II cannons, mortars, and observation bunkers were constructed in a protective ring around the harbor. You\u2019ll see a 1919 searchlight power station that was part of the system and housed huge searchlights that were used to light up the harbor entrance. The searchlight itself was housed a short way down the trail. When it was needed the soldiers wheeled it out on steel tracks, most of which have been removed. From there it could sweep the harbor entrance and illuminate approaching ships and aircraft.  From the tip of Zuniga Jetty, which you can see stretching from North Island southward toward the ocean, a submarine net anchored to Point Loma could be raised to prevent the entry of enemy underwater craft.  Today you can\u00a0also see modern day military defense installations. At the end of the trail is a view of Ballast Point, home to nuclear-powered submarines. Across the bay you can see Naval Air Station North Island.",

Elevation Change:\u00a050 ft.\u00a0(100 ft. if traveling to tidepools from Lot #2) Location:\u00a0Cabrillo Road, bluffs overlooking the Tidepools Parking:\u00a0Tidepool Lot #1 or Tidepool\u00a0Lot #2 Closest Restroom: Pit Toilet at Tidepool Lot #1  Route:\u00a0This dirt\u00a0trail passes\u00a0along the bluffs overlooking the Cabrillo Tidepools.\u00a0This trail can be started from the entrances at Tidepool Lot #1 or #2. It is a 1/2 mile (0.8 km) trip from one lot to the other. Portions of the trail contain steps and there are a few steep slopes. A spur from this trail provides access to the tidepools during low tide events. To return to the trailhead, retrace your steps back the trail entrance you started from.  Directions:\u00a0Once you are in the park, take the turnoff for Cabrillo Rd. and travel down the hill 1 mile (1.6 km) to reach Tidepool Lot #1. Additional parking is available 1/2 mile\u00a0(0.8 km)\u00a0further down the road at Tidepool Lot #2. \u00a0 Safety:\u00a0There are no water sources along this trail. Hikers should plan to bring water and sun protection, especially during the warm summer months. Beware of slippery terrain and waves when on the tidepool spur trail. As in any natural area, there are environmental hazards to watch out for, including toxic plants, animals (such as rattlesnakes), and fragile cliff faces. Coasting Along Cabrillo The Coastal Trail travels along the bluffs on the western side of Cabrillo, just above the tidepools. The path provides an amazing opportunity to take in views of the ocean, delicate bluffs, and the tidepools below (when exposed). The trail near Lot #1 branches in two directions. One portion heads down towards the tidepools while the main trail passes over a small hill and continues along the bluffs towards Lot #2. A spur trail just south of Lot #2 leads to a bluff with\u00a0additional coastal views.  While much of the trail crosses barren badlands, there are ample opportunities to explore the area\u2019s native plant life as well. At any point, you can look upslope to the east and see native Mediterranean Coastal Sage Scrub and Maritime Chaparral plants. This native vegetation was once abundant in southern California but development has left very little acreage remaining. You can also see a strand of rare Shaw\u2019s Agave just south of Lot #2. You may see rangers and volunteers pulling invasive weeds in this area and working in other parts of the park. This work is invaluable in helping preserve the rare ecosystems found withing the park. For example, one recent project led to the resurgence of native sea dahlia!  There is an also opportunity to examine some World War II history during this hike. Near the top of the stairs towards Lot #2, you will come across Searchlight Shelter, No. 15, an underground structure from World War II. What you see from the trail is the sliding roof. Make sure you stay off the roof as it is very unstable!  Regardless of which parking lot you use to start the hike, you return the way you came to finish it.",

Generally, the best months for snowshoeing in the park are December through March, but you can check conditions by calling the park or viewing current conditions on the webcams. Know Before You Go Most of Mount Rainier's roads are closed for winter. The road from Nisqually Entrance to Longmire is open year-round but may close during extreme weather. During the winter season the road between Longmire and Paradise closes nightly, though it may also remain closed during the day due to extreme weather or high avalanche danger. The daily opening/closing status of the gate at Longmire is posted on Twitter @MountRainierNPS\u00a0(account not required to view).  All vehicles are required to carry tire chains when traveling in the park from November 1 to May 1. This requirement applies to all vehicles (including four-wheel drive), regardless of tire type or weather conditions. Safety Many dangers await in winter including avalanches, hypothermia, frostbite, and changing weather, but with a little planning we hope you will have a safe and fun trip to the park. Since conditions change so rapidly on the mountain, it is important to be prepared for anything. Wearing layers is helpful as the conditions change throughout the day.  Especially during the shoulder seasons of winter recreation, it is extremely important to be conscious of unseen hazards. Water flowing under melting snow can carve and melt large voids that may be partially or completely invisible from the surface, hidden under thin layers of snow called snowbridges. Snowbridges are often not marked and\u00a0can be deadly if they collapse underfoot. To avoid this danger:\u00a0   Do not hike alone. A companion may be able to call for help.\u00a0   Check in with a visitor center for current information about hazards in the area where you will be hiking.\u00a0   Stick to well-marked routes over the snow.\u00a0   Avoid hiking in drainages where water is likely to be moving under the snow.\u00a0   Look for holes or depressions in the snow, and listen for the sound of rushing water.\u00a0   When hiking in steep terrain, carry an ice axe or wear traction devices to prevent falls.\u00a0   Carry the \"10 Essentials\",\u00a0including extra food, water, clothing, and navigation aids.\u00a0   Read more about winter safety. How to Snowshoe Snowshoeing is different than any other form of recreation. Depending on the depth of the snow, snowshoeing can be much more tiring than hiking the same trail without snow. It is important to adjust your expectations of how far and how steep you can travel on snowshoes versus hiking in the summer.  People who are not used to walking with snowshoes often find it beneficial to try walking in different ways, such as swinging your hips differently than walking normally. The snowshoes will force your stride to be wider than normal, which can lead to achy hips.  If the snow is particularly deep, use the kick-step technique to flick snow off the front of your snowshoe. As you are bringing your foot up, kick your foot to dislodge the extra snow. You may also need to stop periodically to pick out any snow clumps that have gathered in the spikes of the snowshoe. A trekking pole can be handy for this. Locations All trails outlined below are good options for beginner or intermediate snowshoers. Maps are available at the Longmire Museum, Jackson Visitor Center at Paradise on weekends and holidays, or in the tunnel to the Plaza (Slate) Restrooms at Paradise.  Nisqually Vista Loop\u00a0 Distance:\u00a01.2 mile\u00a0loop trail Estimated Hike Time: 1 hour Trailhead Location:\u00a0Lower parking lot at Paradise Description:\u00a0Throughout most of winter, rangers will put trail markers along the Nisqually Vista Loop, which is a great option for beginner snowshoers. Check with a ranger at the visitor center to see if the trail is marked during your visit. This trail is mostly forested with views of Mount Rainier and the Nisqually Glacier terminus into the Nisqually River. One of the flattest snowshoe options in the park. Alta\u00a0Vista \u00a0 Distance:\u00a01.5 miles Estimated Hike Time: 1.5-2 hours Trailhead Location:\u00a0Main trailhead near the Jackson Visitor Center at the upper lot at Paradise Description:\u00a0This is a popular route for skiers and is usually well established even though it is unmarked. This can also be a good option for an intermediate snowshoe if you continue towards Glacier Vista or Panorama Point. On clear days, views of Mount Rainier, Mt St Helens, Mt Adams, and Mt Hood. Paradise Valley Road\u00a0\u00a0 Distance:\u00a00.6 miles to 4th Crossing or 1.8 miles to Reflection Lakes junction Estimated Hike Time: 45 min - 3 hours depending on turnaround point Trailhead Location:\u00a0East end of the upper parking lot at Paradise Description:\u00a0Out-and-back option that begins with elevation decline. This area can be prone to avalanche so be sure to check avalanche conditions at the visitor center prior to starting. This is also a good intermediate option if you continue up 4th Crossing to Mazama Ridge. Reflection Lakes Distance:\u00a03.75 miles Estimated Hike Time: 4 hours Trailhead Location:\u00a0Narada Falls parking lot Description:\u00a0The lake is frozen over most of winter and is only accessible by snowshoe or cross-country skis. Mostly forested trail with view of Mount Rainier from Reflection Lakes. Throughout most of winter, rangers will put trail markers along to assist with navigation. Follow the marked trail to avoid avalanche prone slopes. Westside Road Distance:\u00a03 miles to summer gate Estimated Hike Time: 2-3 hours Trailhead Location:\u00a0One mile\u00a0after the Nisqually Entrance Description:\u00a0In winter Westside Road is closed to vehicles at the junction with Nisqually Road, but snowshoeing and cross-country skiing is allowed past the gate. The road is a gentle incline for the first three miles to the summer gate at Dry Creek, which can be a good turnaround point for beginners or a rest stop for those wishing to go further. Wonderland Trail to Cougar Rock Distance:\u00a01.7 miles Estimated Hike Time: 1-2 hours Trailhead Location:\u00a0Next to Longmire Wilderness Information Center Description:\u00a0The Wonderland Trail is a 93-mile trail that circumnavigates Mount Rainier. In winter most of the trail is inaccessible, but the section from Longmire to Cougar Rock is accessible. The trail parallels the Nisqually River but stays mostly forested. The trail is often packed down from use so snowshoes are not always necessary\u00a0but will be helpful after a recent storm. Rampart Ridge Distance:\u00a04.5 mile loop Estimated Hike Time: 4 hours Trailhead Location:\u00a0Back side of the Trail of the Shadows Loop, across the street from National Park Inn in Longmire Description:\u00a0This trail often starts with minimal snow on the Trail of the Shadows but the snow deepens as you gain elevation (1,400 ft) to Rampart Ridge. It is mostly forested but will open to views of Mount Rainier at the ridge crest. From the viewpoint,\u00a0return the way you came or continue the loop to finish on the Wonderland Trail.  Equipment For an enjoyable snowshoe walk, you will need:   Snowshoes - The park concessioner rents snowshoes to anyone wishing to snowshoe in the park; check at the Longmire General Store for availability and rental rates. Or you may use your own snowshoes.   Hat   Mittens/Gloves   Suitable, waterproof/water resistant boots (you will sink into the snow even wearing snowshoes so it is important that your feet stay dry.)   Sunscreen   Sunglasses   Dress in layers (avoid cotton which does not dry well)   Trekking poles (not necessary but can be helpful)   Food and water (you will need more food and water in the winter to maintain body temperature)   It is also important to carry the winter 10 essentials:   Shovel (avalanche rescue)   Full length insulated sleeping pad   Stove and fuel (melt snow)   Heat packs   Goggles and wool hat   Gloves (waterproof/lined)   Avalanche transceiver   Avalanche probe   Reliable weather and avalanche forecasts (check at the visitor center)   Map, compass, and GPS (with extra batteries)   \u00a0",

On this tour you will learn the War of 1812 story of Fort McHenry and how the battles, stories, and people, made Baltimore the ORIGINAL \u201cHome of the Brave.\u201d\nBefore we begin, you should know that this tour does lead you into the Star Fort Historic Zone, which is a fee collection area, so if you haven\u2019t paid for access to the fort you should head back to our visitor center, or purchase a Fort McHenry day pass or annual pass by going to recreation.gov on your phone. \n\nAs you begin this tour, reference the large concrete map before you as you learn how it is that Baltimore becomes the focal point of the War of 1812.\n\n On Thursday, June 18, 1812 President James Madison signed a Declaration of War against Great Britain. Many residents in Maryland, especially those in Baltimore\u2014the 3rd largest city in the country as well as one of the nation\u2019s leading ports--welcomed the news. Trade in the port of Baltimore had been greatly curtailed since the trade embargos with Great Britain and France enacted by Presidents Jefferson and Madison. During the rest of 1812 and into 1813, trade boomed in Baltimore. This was helped by the growing list of private ships went out to seize British merchant ships. They would confiscate the cargo and return to port to auction off whatever had been seized, keeping the profits. These privateers had an easy time of it until March of 1813. It was at this time that a fleet of British warships commanded by Rear Admiral George Cockburn sailed into the Chesapeake Bay. \n\nCapturing Baltimore privateers coming down the bay, Admiral Cockburn also proceeded to attack small towns along the Maryland\u2019s eastern shore. The towns of Georgetown and Havre de Grace were attacked and burned. St. Michaels was attacked twice but managed to keep the British from entering the town. In April of that year, Cockburn sailed up the Patapsco within sight of Fort McHenry but did not attack.\n\nIn the spring of 1814, new admiral in charge of the British operations the Chesapeake, Alexander Cochrane issued a proclamation that all enslaved people in the Chesapeake region could gain their freedom by serving in the British forces against the United States. American fears of a slave insurrection grew, and more horror would come as 5,000 British regulars would enter the region having recently been freed up by defeating Napoleon. 1814 was a year of fear and horror for the people of Maryland as British raids and burnings increased, which eventually lead British forces up the Patuxent river trapping a small force of American ships close to its headwaters leading to Washington D.C., from which they began moving towards the nation\u2019s capital. \n\nOn August 24, they roundly defeated American forces at the Battle of Bladensburg, clearing the way for an assault on Washington that evening. The British marched down Maryland Avenue through the heart of the city to burn the Capitol building, and then headed down Pennsylvania Avenue to burn the White House. \n\nBy mid-September, the British fleet had advanced to the Patapsco River where about 4,500 British troops landed at North Point and began an 11-mile march to Baltimore. As the land troops made their way toward the city, British warships moved up the Patapsco River toward Fort McHenry and the other defenses around the entrance to Baltimore Harbor.\u201d",

These brick rectangles represent foundations of buildings that would have been here during the War of 1812.\n\nThe first brick building outline was the Quartermaster & Ordnance Storehouse, which was approximately 100 feet long and had four rooms on the ground floor. The building was used for storage of quartermaster supplies (brooms, buckets, clothing, etc.), and to house a carpenter shop, a leather working shop and a gun shed where field guns and implements were placed to keep them out of the weather. The second floor had usable storage and workspace.\nThe next brick building outline, further up the path was the Ordnance/Commissary Storehouse, which was 75 feet long, and slightly wider than the first. It had three rooms on the ground floor (two in front and single long room in the rear). One room in front was used for the storage of ordnance stores, implements, tackle and rope for the great gun; the other room in front was used as a stable for officer\u2019s horses. The long room in the rear was used for subsistence stores (food) and was there that rations were drawn.\nThe hospital was about 30 yards further and on the right of the road. It was a brick, two-and-a-half story building similar in size and construction to the commander\u2019s quarters, but the fireplaces were on the ends. The hospital had its own kitchen, examination room, operating room, and two wards, one upstairs and the other on the first floor. \n\nFrom the hospital, the road ran along the post boundary to the wharf at the Patapsco River, where the Baltimore City fire boats are docked today. Along the right side of the road were several sheds and wooden buildings, as well as outside work areas, of which nothing remains today, but in 1814 played a significant part in the daily life of the garrison.\n\nThe post hospital at Fort McHenry was under the charge of Dr. William Stewart, Hospital Surgeon's Mate, U.S. Army Medical Department, 10th Military District. Dr. Stewart was authorized to employ four civilian medical staff: a matron and three nurses. The matron received $6 per month, plus daily rations, fuel and bedding straw, while the nurses received $5 per month, plus daily rations, fuel and bedding straw. For those not familiar with military organization, the 10th district was the command one level above Major Armistead. Oversight of hospital personnel was the direct responsibility of Dr. Stewart. Dr. Stewart also employed a civilian cook at the hospital. The hospital cook received $5 per month, plus daily rations, fuel and bedding straw.\n\nlooking up towards the main fort structure there would have been another structure just outside of where the wooden fence is today. This was a brick tavern owned by the Schwartzhouer family. Bricks in the grass indicate the corners of the tavern building. Across the road was a barn belonging to the establishment. The Army took over the structures under lease in 1821 and purchased the entire property in 1831. All of these buildings were important support structures to make Fort McHenry a livable place for soldiers stationed here to protect Baltimore\u2019s harbor.",

Thank you.\n\nThe earth mounds with 4 cannon on a wooden deck in front of you are reconstructed to represent the water batteries which were the main defenses at Fort McHenry that were located outside of the star fort itself. Under the direction of Captain Samuel Babcock, U.S. Army Engineers, civilian laborers, along with members of the First Marine Artillery of the Union, worked throughout the summer of 1813 on improving the Upper and Lower Water Batteries and mounting 18- and 36-pounder naval guns. \n\nAbout 150 feet up the hill from the southeast edge of the Parade Ground was the Upper Water Battery, also known as the \u201cOld Battery.\u201d This was a J-shaped earthwork originally built in 1776 as part of the works at Fort Whetston. In 1813 the works were improved under the direction of Captain Samuel Babcock, U.S. Army Engineers. The battery initially mounted six guns of 18- and 36-pounder size, with at least three more added prior to the battle in 1814.\n\nMagazines were used to hold and protect ammunition, particularly powder and slow match. A 10\u2019 x 20\u2019 brick magazine was located to the rear and just to the left center of the battery. A second, larger (20\u2019 x 20\u2019) magazine was built next to the first, but it is unclear if this was before or after the battle. \n\nThe  Lower Water Battery (located in the Northeast Section) was also dated from 1776. In the summer of 1813, the parapet was rebuilt and extended around the south point of the fort in order to cover the Middle Branch of the Patapsco River. While the parapet was continuous, the guns were mounted in three sections. The Northeastern Section was located just below the Upper Water Battery This section was shaped in a zig-zag fashion. It had a wooden platform and mounted eleven 36-pounder guns. \n\nBrick hotshot furnaces were located at both the upper and lower water batteries. These ovens would heat solid shot cannonballs with the intention of making them able to not only hit British ships, but also set them ablaze. \n\nReference the near by park signage or your park brochure which show a painting depicting the bombardment of Fort McHenry to see the full design of these water battery defenses.\n\nIt would be these guns that were most important to keeping the British ships at bay during the bombardment on September 13-14, 1814.  When the British ships fired upon the fort, they did so from a distance of approximately two miles offshore. The American guns from these batteries only had a range of a mile and a half making them obsolete during most of the battle, though they could keep the British vessels from landing on shore or entering the harbor.",

This room represents how soldiers would have lived in these buildings during the War of 1812.\n\nAt the beginning of the War of 1812, men who enlisted in the Regular Army had a five-year commitment, and while most of the men who enlisted were between the ages of 18 and 35, there were a considerable number of men who served that were in their 50s and 60s as well. In 1812, Privates were paid $5 a month. In addition, every soldier received a bounty of $31 and 160 acres of land. However, because enlistments fell far short of requirements, Congress gradually increased the incentives so that by the end of 1813, recruits were enlisting for the duration of the war rather than five-years, pay was increased by $3 per month to $8, and the bounty was raised to $124 and 320 acres of land. \n\nThroughout the year, the soldiers at Fort McHenry arose at 5:30 A.M. to the sounds of reveille played by the fifes and drums. Bed sacks were doubled to the head of the bunks, with the blankets doubled from the length, turned together in three folds, and laid on top. The rooms were then swept clean, so that no straw or litter was left under the bunks or in the corners.\n\nHalf an hour after reveille, the assembly was sounded, and every man, except the sick, and those already on duty, formed on the parade and the roll was called by the first sergeant. The officer of the day inspected the parade, while the quartermaster went through the barrack-rooms, to ensure that they were clean, in good order, and that every man was turned out. The men were then dismissed back to their barracks, while the first sergeant proceeded to the adjutant's room with his morning report. \n\nA few minutes before breakfast, the sergeants went through the rooms to see that every man was present and that the tables were properly placed, with the utensils laid out ready for the sound of the breakfast call. The bedding was then taken out, (weather permitting), and left to air in whatever place was most convenient for the purpose. This was done under the direction of the quartermaster, who insured that the passages and avenues about the garrison were kept thoroughly clean. The men then employed themselves in getting ready for guard duty or parade.\n\nAt about eight o'clock, the fort's commander made his first round of the quarters, guard house, and hospital, attending to the general good order and cleanliness of the garrison. Junior officers were to be in readiness to attend the commander, should he require them to do so. \n\nThe general morning parade was, in the summer season, held at nine, and in the winter, at ten o'clock. At three quarters of an hour before all general parades, musicians call was sounded by the duty drummer \u2014 at this time, the non-commissioned officers and musicians turned out for inspection by the officer of the day. At the call for morning parade, all the men were formed, and the junior officers inspected their men. \n\nMen selected for fatigue duty and those reporting for sick call were formed separately under their respective non-commissioned officers. The captain then proceeds to size the company, with the shortest man in the center and the tallest men on the flanks and organize it into four sections. The captain then marched his company to the place designated for the morning drill and maneuvered his men for two or three hours.\n\nAt noon, the men were marched back to their barracks and were given one hour for lunch. In the afternoon the men were reformed for artillery drill. Three-quarters of an hour before the general evening parade, all the troops were assembled by the officer of the day for inspection. The men were then allowed to stack arms and walk about freely until the sounding of assembly. In the summer this was at half past five o'clock, and in the winter at four o'clock.\n\nDinner call sounded at six-thirty after which the men could lark, sing, play games, and discuss the rumors of the day. At ten the drums and fifes played tattoo; at which time, letters were finished, the last song was sung, and the games put away. At half past ten taps were sounded, and the lights were put out.\n\nOn Sunday, church parade followed the morning parade, after which the Articles of War were read. At mid-day a general dress parade was held, with the remainder of the day at the disposal of the men, \"and it was hoped that no abuse would be made of the indulgence.",

At Hampstead Hill, the city\u2019s main defense, the British faced over 60 cannons and between 15-18 thousand men within well-constructed earthworks.\n\nTo take Baltimore the British navy would have to sail into Baltimore to assist the army\u2019s attack on the city.\n\nEarly in the morning of September 13, 1814, 17 ships of the British navy sailed up the Patapsco river heading for Baltimore, the third largest city in the United States.\n\nThe main defense along the Patapsco was Fort McHenry. Located on a peninsula two miles from the city, the fort covered the water approaches to the northeast and northwest of the city\nTo the northwest, in the Ferry Branch of the river, were three small forts, Battery Babcock, Forts Covington and Lookout.\nAt Fort McHenry, commanded by Major George Armistead of the U.S. Corps of Artillery, were over 1000 defenders made up of U.S. Army regulars and state militia. With 23 cannons in the fort and 20 on the water battery Fort McHenry could sink any ship within of a range mile and a half.\n\nTo the east, in the Northeast Branch, across the river from Fort McHenry was the 3-gun Lazzaretto Battery, manned by the Chesapeake flotilla.\n\nIn the channel, a line of merchant ships was sunk to obstruct the entry into Baltimore. Behind the sunken ships were 11 gun barges the size of large rowboats, each had a cannon in the bow and one in the stern. Across the narrow channel was also a boom chain in front of the sunken ships.  \n\nAt 6 o\u2019clock in the morning of the 13th, The British ships under the command of Admiral Cochrane approached Fort McHenry. \nThe five bomb ships, with names designed to inspire fear, HMS AETNA, DEVESTATION, METEOR, TERROR and VOLCANO, capable of firing a mortar shell two miles, and the rocket ship EREBUS, began the bombardment of the fort at 6:30 a.m. During the next 25 hours, under a heavy rainstorm for most of the time, 15-18 hundred bombs and rockets would be fired at the fort.\n\nWatching the bombardment aboard a Baltimore packet ship, leased as a truce vessel, was Francis Scott Key. Key was a local lawyer who had been sent by the United States Government to negotiate the release of a U.S. citizen who had been taken prisoner by British forces, a Dr. William Beanes. Although Key was successful in negotiating for the release of Dr. Beanes, British leadership realized he might have overheard plans for the attack on Baltimore, so Key\u2019s ship was detained from leaving the British fleet until the battle was over. Francis Scott Key would be forced to watch the battle from three miles offshore from where you are now. For reference the bridge you see in the distance is 4 miles away.",

Soldiers, sailors, and marines on both sides huddled in the open under pouring rain.\n\nColonel Brooke, in charge of the 4,500 British troops camped North East of the city,  received a communication from Admiral Cochrane that stated, \"in consequence of the entrance of the harbor being closed up by vessels sunk for that purpose by the enemy, a naval co-operation against the town and camp was found impracticable.\"  After deliberating with his officers, Brooke decided that \"the capture of the town would not have been a sufficient equivalent to the loss which might probably be sustained in storming the heights.\" He informed the admiral that he had ordered a \"retreat to take place\u201d the following morning.\"\n\nSeptember 14: Admiral Cochrane received word of Colonel Brookes decision not to attack, too late to abort a diversionary raid up the Middle Branch of the Patapsco River. Shortly after 12:30 a.m. on the Wednesday morning, September 14th, Lieutenant Napier's force of Royal Marines and several hundred seamen in 20 vessels, accompanied by the rocket ship HMS Erebus, made their way, as silently as possible, up the river. \n\nAmerican Sailing-Master John Webster at Battery Babcock, and Lieutenant Newcomb at Fort Covington, both claimed the honor of having first spotted the British force. Both positions opened fire and were soon joined by the guns at Fort Lookout Hill commanded by Lieutenant George Budd.

But that also made the building vulnerable to any sort of flame or sparks that could cause the gun powder to ignite. The building was struck during the bombardment causing part of the roof to collapse, but luckily for the American defenders, the British bomb that struck the building did not explode, meaning the materials inside did not ignite which would have caused a massive explosion, likely causing the fort to fall.\n\nOn the opposite side of the fort wall behind this building is the fort\u2019s dry moat. Stationed in the dry moat were the 38th, 36th, 14th and 12th U.S. Infantry units, a total of 600 US Regulars, sheltering from the bombardment.\n\nThe name William Williams is listed with the names of other recruits on the muster roll of the 38th U.S. Infantry. It seems like any other name, but this name is an alias, a name made up to protect the identity of a young Marylander escaping slavery by joining the United States Army. Federal law at the time said that enslaved persons could not join the army because they \"could make no valid contract with the government\" and it was often necessary for freedom seekers (those escaping slavery to obtain the basic human right of freedom) to create new identities in order to get jobs of any kind.\n\n\u201cWilliams\u201d was the name used by Frederick Hall, or a man who \u201csometimes calls himself Frederick Hall,\u201d according to an escaped slave ad placed in the newspaper with a Forty Dollar Reward by Benjamin Oden. Hall was 21 when he sought his freedom from slavery in Prince Georges County and enlisted on April 14, 1814.\nHall was enlisted as a private in the U.S. Army and was assigned to the 38th U.S. Infantry Regiment. The officer who enlisted William Williams did not question him. Perhaps, William (or Frederick) was able to pass, or move within white society as a white person in order to survive. The newspaper ad posted by Benjamin Oden describes Hall as \"a bright mulatto and so fare, as to show freckles,\" which may mean that he was a light-skinned man. Perhaps the officer was in desperate need of soldiers and looked the other way. Maybe the officer was a man who did not believe in slavery or even wanted to help freedom seekers. Whatever the case, Williams received his enlistment bounty of $50 and was paid a private's wage of $8 per month.\n\nIn early September 1814, the 38th U.S. Infantry was ordered to march to Fort McHenry. During the bombardment, Williams would have been sheltering with his regiment on the opposite side of fort wall behind this building. A month after the battle Williams entered the hospital with tuberculosis, dying from disease during his service in March of 1815.\n\nWilliams was not the only black man to serve in the armed services during the War of 1812. There are numerous records of black sailors. George Roberts, a free black, served on the privateers Chasseur (\"Pride of Baltimore\") and Sarah Ann.

Not knowing for sure when an attack would occur, they spent months preparing for it. Everything was made ready at Fort McHenry to defend Baltimore.\nMajor George Armistead, the Fort\u2019s commanding officer, desired \"to have a flag so large that the British will have no difficulty in seeing it from a distance.\"\n\nIn the summer of 1813, Armistead ordered a large garrison flag (30 feet by 42 feet) as well as with a smaller storm flag (17 feet by 25 feet) for the Fort. The job went out to a 37-year-old widow, Mary Pickersgill, a ship and signal flag maker. She labored for seven weeks with her 13-year-old daughter, Caroline, two nieces, 13-year-old Eliza Young and 15-year-old Margaret Young, a 13-year-old African-American indentured servant, Grace Wisher, and possibly her mother, Rebecca Young, who had taught her the trade. They pieced together strips of loosely woven English wool bunting then laid the whole flag out on the expansive floor of a brewery near Mrs. Pickersgill\u2019s Pratt Street house, now the Star-Spangled Banner House museum. The flags were finished on August 19, 1813.\n\nThe larger of the two flags had stripes two feet wide, and stars 24 inches from point to point. At that time, it was the practice to add one star and stripe for each new state joining the Union. In 1814, the United States flag had 15 stars and 15 stripes.\n\nThroughout the night of the bombardment the smaller 17x25 foot storm flag flew over the fort. The next morning after the British ships had stopped firing and the smoke and fog cleared, Major Armistead ordered the flag lowered replaced by the much larger 30x42 foot garrison flag. Offshore looking anxiously towards the fort, Francis Scott Key waited for a sign of who had won the battle. The site of the massive garrison flag being raised over the fort inspired him to write the words to \"The Star-Spangled Banner,\" our modern-day National Anthem. Today this flag is displayed in the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of American History, Washington, D.C. The smaller storm flag, which was the flag that flew during the rainy bombardment, has been lost to history.",

On his taking command of Fort McHenry in June 1813, Armistead ordered a flag made \"so large that the British will have no difficulty in seeing it from a distance.\" He earned his enduring place in American history under that flag at Fort McHenry whose stalwart defense of Baltimore against British attack in 1814 inspired Francis Scott Key to write \"The Star-Spangled Banner.\" Armistead remained in command of the fort until his untimely death at age 38 on April 25, 1818. He is buried in Old St. Paul's Cemetery, Baltimore, Maryland.\n\nThis statue was dedicated to Major Armistead for the centennial anniversary of the battle in 1914 and has been moved several times before ending up in this spot in 2010.",

This classical monument is dedicated to Francis Scott Key and the soldiers and sailors who took part in the Battle of North Point and the defense of Fort McHenry during the War of 1812.\n\nIn 1914, Congress appropriated $75,000 for a monument at Fort McHenry to mark the centennial of the writing of \u201cThe Star-Spangled Banner\u201d and the defense of Baltimore. A national competition was held by the \u201cFine Arts Commission\u201d on May 28, 1916. One of the 34 entries was a design by Charles H. Niehaus. His work, called Orpheus with the Awkward Foot was chosen.\n\nThere was a delay erecting the statue due to World War I. Finally, the statue was completed, and a dedication was held on Flag Day, June 14, 1922. The ceremony was attended by President Warren G. Harding.The statue was originally placed in the middle of the entrance road with a circular drive around it. In 1962, Orpheus was relocated to the present site.\n\nThe monument consists of a 15-foot high circular base made of white marble. Decorated with a frieze in low relief, the base is surmounted by a 24-foot high figure of Orpheus in bronze, shown playing a five-stringed tortoise-shell lyre. The frieze starts with a portrait shield of Key and the dedication, then continues around the drum of the base with a representation of the classic muses paying honor to the army and navy.\n\nThe marble base bears a medallion honoring Francis Scott Key, flanked by a procession of allegorical figures. The pedestal contains a time capsule filled with documents of patriotic and historical interest. Although the time capsule was opened in 1962, there are no plans to open it in the future.\n\nThe inscription on the base reads:\n\nTo Francis Scott Key - Author of the Star-Spangled Banner and to the soldiers and sailors who took part in the Battle of North Point and the defense of Fort McHenry in the War of 1812.",

The historic zone is designated by the wooden fence that surrounds the fort. This area has 15-dollar fee per adult ages 16 and older. The fee can be paid either online at recreation.gov, or in the park visitor center. Thank you.\n\nThe American Civil War proved to be the greatest test to the \u201cland of the free.\u201d The institution of slavery by 1861 had grown to its greatest prominence, with 4 million people in bondage, primarily in the American South. The divisive issue of slavery had many moments of high tension that eventually boiled over when Abraham Lincoln, the presidential candidate opposed to the expansion of slavery, won the 1860 election. In response, seven slave holding states began to secede from the United States, starting with South Carolina on December 20, 1860. After secessionist forces fired on Fort Sumter on April 12, 1861, four more states seceded including Virginia on April 17th. When Virginia seceded, all eyes turned towards the state of Maryland. Looking at the map on the ground before you, it\u2019s easy to see why. If Maryland, a slave holding state, were to secede from the United States, then Washington D.C., the nation\u2019s capital, would be surrounded. For that reason, Abraham Lincoln had to ask himself\u2026 how close would he follow Francis Scott Key\u2019s words referring to the United States as the \u201cland of the free and home of the brave\u201d both when it came to the issue of slavery, but also the laws, policies, and controversial actions taken here at Fort McHenry to keep Maryland in the United States.",

One of the most notable differences is that the barracks buildings before you have second floors and porches that were added on in the late 1820\u2019s and early 1830\u2019s. The building to your right was originally the commanding officer\u2019s quarters but was converted into enlisted men\u2019s barracks in the 1830\u2019s as well. Larger barracks were necessary due to the presence of larger coastal cannons such as the 1840 coastal guns that surrounded the outside of the fort during the Civil War. These coastal artillery pieces could fire larger shells for greater distances, but also required more men to comprise the gun crews, increasing the garrison size to the point where expansions had to be made. \n\nThe barn shaped structure you see to the right is the powder magazine. This building is larger than it would have appeared during the War of 1812, having been improved and walls thickened to make it bomb proof. If you get close enough to the powder magazine, look for the discoloration of bricks to see where the original roof was. The fort expanded beyond the walls around you as well. Commanding officers had houses down along the east lawn and close to the visitor center. More barracks were constructed where the modern-day Naval Operation Supply Center is, and at other sites that you\u2019ll be taken to on this tour. These facilities further emphasized the fact that during the Civil War \u201cFort McHenry\u201d was more than just the star fort structure, but instead the entirety of this peninsula. Make sure, if you have time, to stop in the timeline room; the room to the far left in Barracks No. 1 to see how the fort\u2019s appearance has changed over time.",

The call for troops enraged Maryland secessionists, raising tensions in Baltimore transitioning the city into a powder keg ready to explode. The crisis came to head on April 19, 1861 when the 6th Massachusetts regiment marched through the city from the President Street Rail Station to the Camden Station on their way to Washington D.C. The sight of United States troops marching through the city infuriated secessionists who began attacking the troops, creating a riot. In the end, 4 soldiers and 12 civilians were killed, and 36 soldiers and hundreds of civilians wounded in what would become known as the \u201cPratt Street Riots.\u201d\n\nWith tensions rising and the outbreak of violence in Baltimore, fear rose that Maryland would secede, thus leaving Washington D.C. surrounded, effectively ensuring an easy victory for the Confederacy. The United States government\u2019s response to the Pratt Street Riots was swift and severe. In July of 1861 General John A. Dix took command of the newly formed Middle Department of the United States Military. Dix set up his command at Fort McHenry and immediately sought to get the secessionist infested city to comply with federal rule. Dix invited several prominent Baltimore women who had known southern sympathies to be entertained at Fort McHenry. During the event Dix took the women up to bastion 1 (where you currently stand) and directed their attention to the large Columbiad cannon. The cannon was pointed in the direction of Monument Square at the center of the city. Dix informed his guests \u201cif there should be another uprising in Baltimore, I shall be compelled to try to put it down; and that gun is the first that I shall fire.\u201d And so, Fort McHenry would continue to operate for the entirety of the Civil War, with cannons pointed to protect the city\u2019s harbor entrance, but also at the city itself.\n\nOther forts were constructed around Baltimore with the same purpose, such as Fort Federal Hill and Fort Marshall, located closer to modern day Patterson Park. Between these three forts, anywhere in the city could be fired upon and the center of town could be fired upon from three different locations. The constant threat of bombardment and enforcement of martial law were just some of the drastic measures taken by the federal government to keep Maryland from seceding. You will learn of another measure taken at your next stop.",

The writ of habeas corpus is what gives a person under arrest the right to be brought before a judge or court. With the writ suspended, any Maryland citizen accused of committing treasonous activities could be arrested and held in prisons like Fort McHenry without ever seeing trial. In September of 1861 a newspaper journalist by the name of Frank Key Howard, grandson of Francis Scott Key, was arrested for writing articles critical of the Lincoln administration in The Daily Exchange, a Confederate sympathizing newspaper. Howard and was held in Fort McHenry under the suspension of habeas corpus. This stroke of irony led Howard to nickname the same fort that inspired his grandfather to write the words \u201cland of the free,\u201d as the \u201cAmerican Bastille.\u201d\n\nAnother Marylander arrested and held at Fort McHenry was John Merryman. Merryman was a member of the Baltimore County Horse Guards, a militia group that, after the Pratt Street Riots, burned railroad bridges leading into Baltimore to prevent US troops from entering the city. Merryman\u2019s plight was brought to the attention of Roger B. Taney, Chief Justice of the Supreme Court. When Taney ordered Merryman be brought to his court room and commanders at Fort McHenry refused, the justice issued a Supreme Court brief, Ex parte Merryman. The brief stated that the authority to suspend habeas corpus did not lie within the president\u2019s power, but instead in Congress\u2019s. The United States Congress would uphold Lincoln\u2019s suspension in 1862. \n\nWhile the majority of the prisoner holding centers were outside of the main fort structure (as you\u2019ll see later in this tour) this guardhouse was used to house the particularly high-risk prisoners. The guards' room before you is quite spacious, however the three adjacent cells are dark and narrow. Henry Hall Brogdan, a member of the Confederate Signal Corps, was captured May 3, 1863, and was imprisoned in the upper-most cell. Brogdan described his time in the cell by stating, \"At no time were the walls of my cell dry, near the wall particularly. Moisture trickled down it the whole time and could fill my hand with a green slime simply by passing it up the face of the wall.\"",

The large earthworks supported by brick were a vast improvement over the much smaller and out of date water battery that had gone around the peninsula. Large powder magazines were constructed under the earthworks to store black powder and ammunition for the guns placed on the outside of the fort. By July 1861 and the start of the Civil War, there was a total of 76 canons and mortars at Fort McHenry including eighteen 42 pounders, fourteen 32 pounders, and seven 24 pounder Columbiad canons. Although out of date for the time of the Civil War, these artillery pieces were vital for protecting Baltimore\u2019s harbor and strong arming the city into submission.\n\nThe large guns you see before you, however, are Rodman guns. Rodmans, better known as the \u201cLincoln Gun,\u201d were developed in the lead up to the American Civil War and are a perfect example of how quickly technology can develop during wartime. At the beginning of the war Rodmans were considered the most up to date technology for coastal defense. Thanks to new and experimental iron casting technology, the large guns could fire massive shells weighing up to 450 pounds a distance of approximately four miles and could outlast traditional cannons. The Army began plans to replace Fort McHenry\u2019s guns in 1864, however due to production needs and the manpower needed to transport the massive guns (some weighing as much as 50,000 pounds) the first Rodmans did not arrive until 1866, a year after the Civil Wars conclusion. By this time the Lincoln Gun was out of date. Its traditional muzzle loading process was being replaced with breech (or rear) loading technology. In addition, its smooth bore barrels were less accurate than those with rifled barrels, although some of the cannons before you were converted later.\n\nFort McHenry\u2019s fourteen Rodmans are the largest collection in the United States. Their continued preservation and display give the fort the appearance of most coastal defenses from the American Civil War.",

This site represented fear and dread for the imprisoned Confederate soldiers, spies, guerillas, and blockade runners, but also served as a warning to Union soldiers who may be considering crimes such as desertion or murder.\n\nOne Confederate executed on this site was Andrew Laypole, a Captain in the Confederate Army, also known by his alias Isadore Leopard. Captured in April of 1863 outside of Winchester, VA, Laypole was accused of being a Confederate guerilla and was sentenced to death which occured on May 23, 1864. A newspaper reported the scene as such: \n[he] made a short address to those around him, stating that he appeared as a felon, but there was one who knew he was not of that character. He said freely [and] forgave all having to do with his death\u2026 on the conclusion of which the rope was placed around his neck, and everything being in readiness, the word was given and he was suspended in the air.\n\nTwo years prior, on March 7, 1862, Private Joseph Kuhne of the 2nd Maryland Regiment of the United States Army was executed on the same spot. Kuhne had killed his Second Lieutenant just six months prior. He was to be made an example of so other soldiers, specifically those garrisoned at Fort McHenry, knew the consequences of such actions. 4,000 Federal troops gathered on these grounds to witness Kuhne\u2019s execution. With the audience in attendance and Kuhne in position on the scaffold the scene was described:\n\nWhen Col. Morris inquired if he had anything to say before his death, the doomed man replied that he had not. In another instant the trip fell with a dull heavy sound, and Joseph Kuhne was suspended in mid-air\u2026  which he hung still and lifeless\u2026\n\nAt least five soldiers and/or spies sentenced to death at Fort McHenry are known to have had their sentences commuted by President Lincoln. In one such case Private George W. Kimball of the 5th Massachusetts Regiment said of Lincoln\u2019s pardon, \u201cThe President has seen fit to have their sentences changed to imprisonment. I think he shows [too] much leniency for I think if anyone should be hung it is a [spy].\u201d",

As you heard earlier, technology develops quickly in times of need. The new and upgraded armaments used more powder than the fort had space for. Improvements were hastily made. New powder magazines were built into the ravelin and outer battery. In the Sally Port, the old bombproof casements were expanded as well. However, as noted by an officer, storing large amounts of powder in the Sally Port wasn\u2019t the wisest decision. The main entrance to the fort was vulnerable to \u201ccommon throughfare, with people passing all the time, [and] men smoking.\u201d  \n\n In 1863, these concerns led the War Department to approve the building of a detached powder magazine.  Located well outside the fort, the magazine in front of you would help solve Fort McHenry\u2019s storage crisis. The inner brick vault is 28 feet by 50 feet and is built with very thick walls. A courtyard separates the inner structure from the outside wall. Completed in April 1864, the Civil War Powder Magazine can hold 1,500 barrels of powder. \n\nAlthough outside of the star fort structure, the powder magazine was still in the heart of activity of Fort McHenry. It\u2019s important to note that during the Civil War \u201cFort McHenry\u201d was a name for not only the star fort, but the entirety of this peninsula. Between this structure and the water would have been sutler tents, store tents, and even a hospital tent. The large grassy area you see between this building and the road was the fort\u2019s parade ground. This was the area that the fort\u2019s large garrison would gather to march in formation and go through cannon and musket drills, all important tasks to keep the soldiers sharp and ready for battle.\n\nThe next stop proceeds to the main gate.

During the early 1860\u2019s, the gate and it\u2019s brick walls separated Fort McHenry from tension-filled Baltimore. Outside of the gate, concerned women left fresh vegetable and food to be delivered inside.   Inside the gate, regiments of United States soldiers went about their daily duties, and prisoners found creative ways to pass the time. \n\nIn April of 1861 this gate was the site of major tension. Following the Pratt Street Riots Fort McHenry remained on high alert preparing for any pro-secessionist attack that might occur. Field pieces were moved into position to be able to fire down the fort road ahead of you if any enemy forces came into range. On April 20th the Baltimore Police Commissioner, John Davis, offered to send a force of 200 men to help repel any attack that may take place. The fort\u2019s commander at the time, Captain John Robinson, fearing that the force of men would actually be secessionists, informed Davis that if any men came past the Catholic chapel on the fort road that he would fire upon them, and then the city. The police commissioner replied, \u201cIf you do that, and if a woman or child is killed, there will be nothing left of you but your brass buttons to tell who you were.\u201d And so, the standoff between Fort McHenry and the City of Baltimore would continue throughout most of the war.  \n\nIn July of 1862, nearly 2,000 soldiers were being medically treated in Baltimore. Over 1,000 more were at Fort McHenry. On September 17, 1862 the battle of Antietam would take place in Western Maryland. Being the bloodiest single day in American history with 23,111 casualties, medical facilities in the state and Baltimore were overwhelmed. A hospital was constructed at Fort McHenry to the left of the gate in front of you to accommodate the arriving wounded. Women of Baltimore brought food and supplies to the wounded Confederate soldiers being treated within the gate. So many supplies were being brought to this gate that General Morris ordered:  \n\n\u201cno person or carriage whatsoever will be permitted within the gates of Fort McHenry with clothing or provisions to the rebel prisoners. Supplies of this kind will be deposited with the guard at the exterior gate for that office, where they will be duly distributed to those requiring this aide.\u201d \n\nToday, we encourage you to look past the gate and into Baltimore. This gate was the first thing a prisoner would see upon arriving to the Fort.

The rooms were designated to hold different categories of prisoners, such as Confederate Prisoners, Union Bounty Jumpers, Citizens, and African Americans. Additionally, there was one room for guards and one that contained seven cells. These cells nicknamed \u201cThe Black Hole of Calcutta\u201d, contained the more violent prisoners at Fort McHenry. These first two prisons were surrounded by a courtyard and a 25-foot-high stockade wall. This courtyard was used for exercise, rollcall, and recreation. \n \nPrisoners came up with creative ways to pass the time. While lively and intellectual discussions and debates were present, they also played games using what was around them. For example, one prisoner recalled a \u201cgreat sport\u201d where lice from the prisoners were made to fight against ants. Some recreational activities were not just to pass time, but also served to mock the United States Soldiers around them. One such activity mimicked the morning dress parade, complete with a drum-major and musicians.  \n \nIn July of 1863, after the Battle of Gettysburg, the prison population swelled to 6,957 POWs. With limited space for the large influx of Confederate Prisoners, the third stable, previously used for officer\u2019s horses, was converted so fast that as prisoners were led in, the horses were led out.  Reverend T.D. Witherspoon described the cells as such:\nThe floor, which separated us from our neighing neighbors beneath us, was full of broad seams from the shrinkage of boards of which it was composed, so that the hot, steamy air from below had full access to us, and during the oppressive days and sultry nights of July and August, with the thin roof of shingles between us and the sun, and the steam arising from the stalls beneath, our situation was anything but comfortable\u2026\n\nMost prisoners would not spend a long time in the \u201cAmerican Bastille\u201d. Fort McHenry was used as a temporary stop before they were transferred to a more permanent location. Over 15,000 people would be held at Fort McHenry from 1861-1865. By September 1865, only four remained, and the Union, following four years of conflict and bloodshed, remained intact.",

It may seem like just a simple trail, but if you look closely it will tell the story of the progression from footpaths to roadways.\n\nImagine what this island would look like with no roads\u2026. How about with no trails! It would certainly be difficult to get around in this rugged lava landscape. When the Polynesian Voyagers arrived in the Hawaiian Islands, that was their reality. An untouched, rugged, lava wilderness. So, in ancient times, a network of trails was constructed to connect people, places, and resources.\n\nThis section of trail is called the 1871 Trail, due to improvements made in\u2026 You guessed it, 1871. However, this small segment of trail is just one section of the larger Ala Kahakai National Historic Trail which is the 175-mile-long trail corridor that traverses from the northernmost tip of the island, along the western edge, around the southern tip and into Puna.\n\nThis historic trail generally follows the ancient coastal\u202falaloa, or long trail that formed primary route of travel around the island. The alaloa that the Ala Kahakai NHT follows is sometimes referred to as the \"alanui aupuni,\" the Hawaiian Kingdom government road, that you can still see as the \"King's Trail\" in North Kona/South Kohala or the \"M\u0101malahoa Trail\" in North Kona which intersects our sister park, Kaloko-Honok\u014dhau National Historical Park. This ancient network of trail also included shorter more locally important trails like the alahele that ran laterally with the shoreline, and the\u202fmauka-makai\u202ftrails, that ran from upland areas to coastal areas.\n\nOver the years, many of these anicent trails were straightened and widened to reflect changes in transportation while others were simply abandoned. Some of the trails that survived the tests of time were preserved, like the Ala Kahakai NHT, or even converted into roadways we know today. As you continue down the trail you see evidence of this evolution as you will pass historic and ancient structures, see impressive geologic features, and immerse yourself in the kahakai (coastal) environment.",

He\u02bbe h\u014dlua, \"sled surfing,\" or \"land sledding,\" was an important ritual-sport in Hawai\u02bbi. A h\u014dlua slide was made of dry-set stones taking advantage of the natural inclines or hills to create a long-sloped ramp that was then covered in fresh soil and reeds making a slick surface which was then lubricated with kukui (candlenut) oil.\n\nIndividual riders rode down the slide on a papa h\u014dlua (sled), often reaching speeds of up to 60 miles per hour (96.6 kph) The papa h\u014dlua was carved from wood and was long and narrow in shape with two runners held apart by crosspieces. Two smaller rails sat on top of the crosspieces and acted as a platform. The whole sled was lashed together with coconut fiber. The sled could be as long as 14 feet (4.3 m) and weigh as much as 50 pounds (22.7 kg). See a functional replica of a papa h\u014dlua in the bookstore at the visitor center.\n\nThe papa h\u014dlua's design allowed riders a choice of different riding techniques on their journey to the bottom of the slide, with two techniques being the most popular. Riders using the first technique would stand sideways on the papa h\u014dlua, kick with one foot to launch themselves, and then put both feet on the sled and extend their arms for balance \u2013 much like a modern snowboard rider. Sliders using the second technique would jump onto the papa h\u014dlua chest-down, face forward, and grip the narrow sled tightly for control. Both techniques allowed skilled sliders to steer the papa h\u014dlua by shifting their body weight. Control of the papa h\u014dlua was essential as a mistake or loss of control meant injury or possible death.\n\nHe'e h\u014dlua was a prestigious ritual-sport in the Hawaiian Islands. It was played mostly during Makahiki, the four-month winter New Year's celebration in honor of the akua (god) Lono, and only the Hawaiian ali'i (chiefs) would compete in these races.\n\nWould you be brave enough to test your skill on the papa h\u014dlua?",

These curbstones were part of improvements made to the 1871 trail when it was widened to easily accommodate two horses at one time.

Historical accounts collected over the years indicate that access to Ki\u02bbilae, prior to the construction of the ramp, was via a ladder or rope. So, it was pretty dangerous!\n\nThere is no clear indication as to when the original ramp was built, but it most likely occurred sometime in the mid-1800s when a series of large-scale government programs were initiated to improve to public resources, such as roadways. However, the first version of the ramp would definitely not have held up to our modern-day safety standards. Local paniolo (Hawaiian cowboys) described the original ramp as the \u201cone-foot-out trail,\u201d as they would ride up and down the ramp with one foot out of the stirrup just in case they had to make a hasty escape due to the poor condition of the ramp.\n\nDue to this dangerous part of the commute to Ki\u02bbilae village, improvements were made in 1868 to widen and stabilize the ramp. In a letter to the Hawaiian Kingdom Minister of the Interior dated Feb. 4, 1868 George Hardy, the road supervisor at the time, said:\u202f\n\n\"In South Kona, I have repaired [a very] bad place known by the name of Alahaka in the village of Ki'ilae, a place of great danger where several horses had been kill'd: and where people were [sic] in danger of going up and down. I have made it wide and a substantial road.\"\n\nUnfortunately later that year, in 1868 there was a particularly destructive eruption event from Mauna Loa that caused multiple massive earthquakes (7-7.9) which in turn caused tsunamis and landslides across the island. During this event, the ramp may have been damaged and by the late 1890\u2019s the Alahaka Ramp had fallen into a state of disrepair. In a letter dated December 31, 1897 road supervisor T. H. Wright wrote:\n\n\"Napo\u2019opo\u2019o to Ho\u2019okena beach road in a fearful condition, it needs repair of the worst kind. The Walahaka [Alahaka] pali (cliff) is very dangerous. This road is used every day for the convenience of the public, going and back to these places.\"\n\nOver the years, repairs were made, but in 1951, a large earthquake caused an upper section of the ramp to slough off and that continued to deteriorate. So, when the National Park Service came in, about twelve years later, the ramp was once again in a state of disrepair. This prompted a major stabilization project to restore and strengthen the Alahaka Ramp. Stabilization efforts consisted of removing the earthquake-damaged sections, clearing away boulders, and rebuilding the entire\u202fmakai\u202f(ocean-facing) side.\n\nGiven its proximity to the ocean and the cliffside, even today the Alahaka Ramp requires periodic maintenance and stabilization as a result of high surf, storm, and earthquakes. During the most recent effort, which occurred in 2010, NPS crews repaired a damaged portion of the outer face and stabilized the ramp buttress and trail trea This, of course, was no easy feat, as the work was located right along the steep ocean cliffside.\n\nAs the years go on, and climate change causes increased storm intensity and sea level rise, these coastal trails will require a sustained joint effort to continue to preserve these pieces of history and the stories they contain. What is something or someplace that means a lot to you that is threatened by climate change? What efforts do you hope are taken to preserve it?",

And for the John Ahu house site that you see before you on the makai side of the trail, the location was in a very prime spot indeed! Not only for expansive ocean views that would cause the price of this house site to soar in modern times, but also easy access to the main route of travel and the ocean. Below the house site is one of the few suitable canoe landing spots along this stretch of coast. As you continue down the trail a little bit, look back up at the house site and notice the gradual slope down to the water. That\u2019s the spot! In addition to being able to land a canoe, this cove was also the only place with deep enough sheltered waters for larger boats to unload goods to exchange with villagers.\n\nWhen finding a place for one\u2019s house, it\u2019s important to make sure that you are close to all amenities, especially water. While there is certainly ample saltwater available at this location, fresh water is often hard to come by. In this part of the island, there are no streams or rivers to provide freshwater and instead, freshwater sources are either collected rainwater or the brackish water of anchialine pools. \n\nIn Ki\u02bbilae village most of the houses had thatched roofs and only the most well-to-do houses, like the John Ahu house, had tin roofing. With tin roofing came the ability of water catchment, and thus the cistern that you can see in what remains of the house site. However, even with water catchment, rain on the South Kona coast is not guaranteed, and in many cases, the Ahu cistern had to be filled via mule train from the wetter areas up mauka (mountain). \n\nEven today, many residents of South Kona live on rainwater catchment systems, however when the catchment is low, water trucks and roads allow for much easier access to freshwater than the mule trains of the past.",

                        "audioTranscript": "Ki\u02bbilae Village offers a glimpse into the past, when Hawai\u02bbi was changing rapidly, but still supported traditional aspects of daily life. With the arrival of Europeans in the Hawaiian Islands, many things changed. New plants and animals were introduced and settlements began moving away from the coastal villages to the more fertile uplands and larger harbor cities. What remains in Ki\u02bbilae today are abandoned house sites, agricultural features, animal pens, and salt pans that can be seen from more recent times.\n\nIt is not known exactly when Ki\u02bbilae village was established, but it may have been inhabited as early as the 1600\u2019s due to availability of water, fishing grounds and upland fields. Indigenous knowledge points to the early settlement at Ki\u02bbilae as a place where kahuna (priests) trained. By the end of the 19th century, Ki\u02bbilae had a population of approximately 100 people consisting of about 10 extended families.\n\nUnlike the difficulty assigning a beginning date for Ki\u2018ilae Village, the end of its occupation is well documented. By 1913 only one family remained in coastal Ki\u2018ilae, and sometime the 1930\u2019s the last full time resident moved away. Its depopulation was largely the result of a changing economy that focused increasingly around the mauka areas near the current M\u0101malahoa Highway. Green (1993:534) explains the changing economy and shifting population with the following:\n\nThe improved belt road around the island, which provided access to trade centers, effectively isolated the shoreline settlements, causing much of their population to move inland nearer to the road and the kula garden areas.\n\nSo, it seems that the change in community pattern along this coast was triggered not only from the evolution of transportation in the area, but also a change in the economy from a barter economy to a \u201cwork-for-money\u201d economy.\n\nAs you continue along the trail into the heart of Ki\u02bbilae village, remember to stay on trail and practice Leave No Trace principles to help protect these sites.",

They were fisherman.\n\nLike many Ki\u02bbilae residents, fishing was essential for survival, but it was hard work. Most fishing gear was handmade, including the wooden canoes used to access the coastal waters. Fisherman, like the Kahikinas, would fish for \u02bb\u014dpelu (mackerel scad) as well as ahi (tuna) if two people were available to haul the large fish aboard. Fisherman would often feed the fish, banging on the outside of their canoe beforehand to alert the fish. The fish would then gather, and a large catch could easily be achieved. These fish were a major source of income for members of the community. Fresh fish were sold by girls door-to-door before school and any fish leftover could be dried and sold to stores.\n\nJohn Kahikina, one of the last to leave Ki\u02bbilae, was an expert octopus fisherman. To see below the surface of the water when he was fishing, he would chew kukui nuts and then spit them in the water. The oil from the kukui nuts would create a make-shift window to the depths, allowing him to drop his lure on top of the octopus and quickly pull it up.\n\nHowever, as times begain to change, the traditional way of living could no longer sustain the remaining Kahikinas and as Frances Jackson states in his report on Ki\u02bbilae Village,\n\n\u201cJohn Kahikina explained, there was \u201cNothing to do, no work.\u201d The coastal waters still could be fished, the kula gardens were there, but the economy had changed; a money-making job was almost a necessity.\u201d",

These trails are referred to as mauka-makai trails and highlight the importance of connecting the resources available from mountain to ocean.\n\nIn ancient Hawai\u02bbi, the land was divided into long sections called ahupua\u02bba that ran from the mountain to the ocean providing the people living in them almost everything they needed to survive. Larger trees for carving from the forest, fertile lands with ample rainfall in the kula (uplands), and abundant ocean resources from the kahakai (coastal area). Resources from each area were meticulously managed and shared throughout the ahupua\u02bba along mauka-makai trails.\n\nWhile the primary village area for Ki\u02bbilae was concentrated in this coastal area around the 1871 trail, as historian Frances Jackson (1966) states,\u201cto attempt to show Ki\u2018ilae Village as existing only at the shore would show barely a third of the life of the villagers.\u201d \n\nFamilies also maintained kula gardens with \u02bbuala (sweet potato), yams, pumpkins, squash, k\u014d (sugar cane), papaya, mai\u02bba (bananas), pia (arrowroot), ipu (gourds), and ulu (breadfruit). These kula gardens were located far enough upslope to receive regular rain. In addition to kula gardens, many also cared for dryland kalo (taro) fields located even further upslope. A network of trails connected fields to field houses and to a mauka-makai trail that served as the main artery for travel between the mauka gardens and the coastal residences.\n\nThis is no longer a maintained trail.

Later, stone walls were modified to accommodate ranching operations in the area.\n\nWithin the walls would be a house platform upon which a house would be built. In Ki\u02bbilae village, the majority of the houses were the old-style thatched grass houses. However, the more \u201cwell-to-do\u201d houses were constructed with modern lumber and had tin roofs, like the John Ahu house. Showing the transitional nature of these times, some houses met halfway with thatched walls and a tin roof. Houses typically were just one large room for the entire family.\n\nOne of the things that all of these house site had in common was the lack of a bathroom or even a pit outhouse. Bathing was done in the ocean and other activities were just done outside or in the tidal areas. The village also did not have electricity. In the evenings, light was provided by kerosene lanterns or kukui nut lights in which sundried kukui nuts were strung onto coconut midribs and lit. According to residents, one string of kukui nuts would last half the night.\n\nIn the \u201cyard\u201d of the pa hale families would grow any useful or decorative plant that could survive in the dry coastal environment, but most of the food was grown in the kula gardens upslope. \u201cYards\u201d would also have a designated area for garbage, sometimes walled off from the rest of the area.\n\nHow are these traditional pa hale different or similar to the home you live in today?",

The park\u2019s namesake, Fort Raleigh, is a small earthwork likely constructed in 1585 by an English military expedition, the second of four English expeditions to arrive at Roanoke Island in the 1580s. The third English expedition in 1587 is known as the \u201cLost Colony.\u201d Archaeologists and historians are still unsure if this earthwork has any relationship to the lost colony as the diaries of lost colony governor John Wright seemed to indicate that their settlement was independent of this earthwork. The 115-man military expedition, under the command of Ralph Lane, arrived at Roanoke Island in the summer of 1585. Initially greeted warmly by the native Algonquian the relationship between the two groups soon broke down, primarily due to disease the English brought which the Algonquian had no immunity to. The construction of this earthwork may reflect the need for the 115-man English force to protect themselves from Algonquian attacks as relations deteriorated or possibly to defend against the Spanish who sometimes sailed the coastline of the Outer Banks.  It is also possible that this earthwork was constructed to defend an English metallurgy workshop that operated nearby. We do know that Ralph Lane had prior experience designing and constructing other earthworks in Ireland and the Caribbean. The earthwork likely housed a small number of cannons, a powder magazine and other small rudimentary structures. Note the earthwork\u2019s small size, however. It is unlikely the 115 manned attachment would have been able to occupy it at one time. This has led archaeologists and historians to theorize that the earthwork could possibly be a smaller satellite structure with a larger defensive structure as yet unearthed. Despite the uncertainty as to the earthwork\u2019s purpose, its existence is evidence of the early English presence here on Roanoke Island. The location of the earthwork has been known for centuries. President James Monroe visited the site in 1819 and civil war soldiers stationed on Roanoke Island frequently wrote about the earthwork\u2019s existence in diaries and letters. The first official excavations of the earthwork took place in 1947 under the direction of archaeologist J.C. Harrington. In 1950 the earthwork was reconstructed on its original perimeter.",

Thomas Harriot was a prominent English scientist of the day sent by Queen Elizabeth and Sir Walter Raleigh.

Joaquin Gans, a Czech mineralogist, was the first recorded Jewish person to set foot in what is now known as North America. Together Harriot and Gans experimented with mineral deposits in an attempt to obtain the mineral wealth that the English desired, however they never found any precious metals here.

Premiering in the spring of 1937, the drama was a result of a resurgence of interest in the lost colony, a social and political reaction to the great depression and the beginning of World War II. On August 18th, 1937, the 350th anniversary of Virginia Dare\u2019s birth, President Franklin D. Roosevelt attended a performance of the drama after delivering a speech nearby. The marker noting his visit is located in the garden at the back row of seating.

Take a moment to consider that this tiny 10-mile-long by 2-mile-wide island situated precariously on the Outer Banks was home to not one but two lost colonies. The first that established Roanoke Island as the birthplace of English North America and the second that established Roanoke Island as a birthplace of freedom and hope for thousands of enslaved persons.

The acequias were known as the life blood of the missions because without them the Spanish wouldn\u2019t have been able to settle in this area. Acequia systems had three main components: the dam, the ditches, and the aqueduct. You will see each of these components on the acequia tour.",

These communities grew as more and more African Americans migrated to West Virginia in search of jobs. A source of both unity and heritage, black communities provided the essential elements for everyday living and survival.\n\nFor the men, the community helped meet their economic expectations through work in the mines, on the railroad, in timber or rock quarries. It also provided a safe haven away from work. A place to be a family: to socialize, recreate, attend church, and relax. For the women, the community was their home and their job. They worked to maintain the home, take care of the children and performing household chores. The women shopped for groceries and other necessities. They fed the chickens, hogs and other livestock and often raised a garden.  A few women were able to contribute to the household income as domestic workers in the homes of white families or in service-oriented jobs.       \n\nHaving a religious affiliation and organizing a church was a significant element of the African American community. Most residents were Baptists who enthusiastically participated in church services on Sundays and throughout the week. The church, like Quinnimont Missionary Baptist Church, offered both spiritual and social activities weekly and throughout the year. These events regularly brought families and the community together. Important events included day-long Sunday programs, weekly socials, gospel sings and annual events. Helen Powell notes that at her church in Glen Jean, West Virginia,\n\n\u201cWe would have cookies and ice cream for the kids on Children\u2019s Day. There was always a Mother\u2019s Day program and programs for Father\u2019s Day.  They would have big birthday dinners, and everybody would pitch in and bring a dish. It was like a community affair.\u201d  \n\nLiving in an industrial setting did not totally eliminate agricultural pursuits within the black community.  A household garden supplemented the family income and added variety to the diet.  On whatever space was available, African Americans grew vegetables. Small orchards of apple, pear, and cherry trees were common. Children and adults alike foraged for berries as they ripened during the summer months. Black walnuts and chestnuts were gathered in the woodlands during the fall. It was common to raise some kind of livestock, mostly chickens and hogs. All foods were eaten fresh, shared among community members or canned for winter use.\n\nMost African Americans growing up in this region remember that the work was hard and at times life was tough. However, they also remember having fun and time for recreational interests.  African American families loved to visit spending most Sunday afternoons with friends and family members. They enjoyed participating in baseball leagues, going to the movies, and attending musical events. Fishing and hunting were a pastime that many young boys and their fathers enjoyed doing together. Residents always looked forward to the annual visit of the Silas Green traveling minstrel show and its variety of black performers.  Mr. Ellis Ross recalls some of his memories growing up as a child,\n\nChildren attended 4-H camp during the summer at Camp Washington Carver. There were all kinds of quartets around town and people played different instruments.  At times, it was just like a talent thing, but for self-enjoyment and entertainment. Back then you didn\u2019t have a TV so they entertained themselves.\u201d  \n\nEven though life for African Americans was at times very difficult, the support of churches, schools, and family built a strong community.",

                        "audioTranscript": "Camp Washington Carver\nWritten by:\tDr. Brucella Jordan\nNarrated by:\tXavier Oglesby\n\nCamp Washington Carver opened its doors in 1942 as the first 4-H camp for African Americans in the United States. Originally named \u201cThe West Virginia Negro 4-H Camp,\u201d it became known locally simply as \u201cClifftop.\u201d Each year, black children from all over the State came to enjoy the fun and experience of being a camper.\n\nAlthough not a 4-H camper himself, Norman Jordan recalls his memories of the camp. \u201cI had very vivid memories of going to the camp \u2026 to play baseball, swim, and have church picnics. Sometimes Dad would take me and my brothers and sisters along, and as soon as the car stopped at the camp we would jump out and run around on the grounds. [We would] bounce up and down on the see-saw, slide down the sliding board, and most of all ride on the merry-go-round.  [ I remember] the smell of chlorine at the bathhouse and the swimming pool, as well as the happy sounds of swimmers splishing and splashing in the water and diving off the diving board.\u201d \n\nThe seeds for an African American 4-H camp were planted in 1928 when West Virginia University hired James E. Banks and Lulu B. Moore.  As State Extension Agents, they were tasked with investigating 4-H Club activities for black children within the State.  Their report showed that forty-four of West Virginia\u2019s counties held 4-H camps for white campers, but no camps existed for black campers.  \n\nWith this information in hand, Dr. John W. Davis, president of West Virginia State College, began the process of seeking funding for an African American 4-H camp.  Other African American leaders in the state joined his efforts. Nearly a decade later, the West Virginia legislature appropriated $25,000.00 for the creation of a 4-H camp for black campers. The efforts of Dr. Davis also led to the receipt of a large Works Progress Administration (WPA) grant to help construct the camp.\n\nDr. Davis, who had \u201cfallen in love with the beautiful scenery and serenity of the land\u201d in the Clifftop area, chose the current location for the camp. Construction of the first buildings occurred between 1939 and 1942. WPA and Civilian Conservation Corps workers, along with prison laborers from Moundsville were the earliest construction crews. The Great Lodge, the largest log structure on site, was built entirely of West Virginia chestnut. It housed the assembly hall, dining hall, and kitchen. Other buildings included a two-room Guest House, a small cabin used as a Health Center, and dormitories for campers. A water tank and pond were also constructed.\n\n Use of the camp began immediately and reached its peak during the 1950s, when approximately 1,600 campers attended annually. A camper\u2019s day began with an early breakfast followed by cabin cleaning. The main part of the day was spent in activities including nature study, music, drama, and arts and crafts. Campers had instructional time in swimming, first aid, health care, and nutrition. Of course, recreational time included swimming and sporting activities.  After supper, campers had free time, followed by a play, evening vespers, and a camp fire.       \n \nBesides the 4-H camps, the African American community utilized the facility for a wide variety of activities and events. Boy Scout and Girl Scout camps, mining encampments, home economics encampments, church camps, and reunions were held here. The buildings were used for meetings, gatherings, and training classes by groups and organizations from around the state. West Virginia State College conducted staff and faculty trainings and special classes at the camp. The site was used for pre-season band and football conditioning by black schools. The camp was also utilized for the military training of black pilots and ROTC maneuvers. \n\nStatewide integration in the 1950s eliminated the need for a separate 4-H camp for African Americans. However, the creation of the camp in the 1940s filled a void in the lives of many West Virginia black residents. The Camp provided learning and recreational opportunities and instilled pride and built self-esteem in thousands of black youth. The Camp provided a safe environment for black children to participate in and enjoy amenities normally unavailable to them.  \n\nIn 1980, the camp was placed on the National Register of Historic Places and the name officially changed to Camp Washington Carver. Today, the Camp serves as a cultural arts center for the West Virginia Department of Culture and History.",

Workman \nNarrated by:\tAdrienne Jenkins and Joshua Flynn (quote)\n\n\u201cWhen you control a man\u2019s thinking you do not have to worry about his actions. You do not have to tell him not to stand here or go yonder. He will find his \u201cproper place\u201d and will stay in it. The mere imparting of information is not education.\u201d  Carter G. Woodson\n\nWest Virginia can boast of more than its share of great African-American leaders. Booker T. Washington and Henry L. Gates are among those who have made significant impacts on American thought and culture. Another leader who made a deep impact was Carter G. Woodson, the educator, historian, and publisher who founded the whole genre of African-American history. Woodson was the only American of slave parentage to earn a Ph.D. in history.  He wrote and published nineteen books and numerous articles, founded the first scholarly journal dedicated to African-American history, and started Negro History Week, which eventually became our current Black History Month.  \n\nAlthough Dr. Woodson\u2019s greatest achievements came later in life while he lived in Washington, D.C., his spent his formative years in West Virginia as a coal miner and educator. Woodson was born in 1875 near New Canton in Buckingham County, Virginia. Both his father and mother were former slaves. Poor, but fiercely independent, his father valued education and taught Carter to be \u201cpolite to everybody, but to insist always on recognition\u201d and respect. Frustrated by the lack of opportunity in Virginia, young Woodson left the family farm in 1892. He followed the Chesapeake & Ohio Railway into the New and Kanawha River region and found work on the railroad laying ties near Charleston. \n\nWoodson went to work at the Nuttallburg mine in the New River coal field at the age of seventeen or eighteen.  He worked hard in the mines, but also worked to receive an education and learned what little there was available on black history. Oliver Jones, who operated a tearoom for black miners out of his home, upon learning that Woodson was literate, engaged him to read the daily newspapers to the miners in return for free treats. Woodson later referred to Jones\u2019s establishment as \u201call but a reading room,\u201d with volumes that described black history, particularly stories of black Civil War veterans. His political education grew also as he read \u201cspeeches, lectures, and essays dealing with civil service reform, reduction of taxes, tariff for revenue only, and free trade.\u201d\n\nWoodson left Nuttallburg in 1895 and returned to Huntington to attend Frederick Douglass High School, the city\u2019s only black high school. He graduated in two years, and enrolled at Berea College in Kentucky, one of the few colleges that offered interracial education. He enrolled for only one quarter, but he picked up enough credits later at the University of Chicago to earn his bachelor\u2019s degree from Berea in 1903.   \n      \nWoodson returned to Fayette County in the late 1890s to teach at a school in Winona, just five miles from Nuttallburg. According to his biographer, he taught at \u201ca school established by black miners for their children\u201d from 1897 to 1900.  The 1900 Federal Census lists Carter G. Woodson as a \u201cboarder\u201d in the household of William M. Shorts. It also notes that he is 23 years old, single, Virginia-born, and working as a \u201cPublic School Teacher.\u201d\n\nWoodson left Winona in 1900 to return to Huntington where he taught history and was the principal at Douglass High School until 1903. From 1903 to 1907, he traveled to the Philippines to teach and serve as supervisor of schools and teacher-training. Woodson returned to the United States to attend graduate school. He obtained his master\u2019s degree in history at the University of Chicago, and his doctorate in history from Harvard. \n\nDr. Carter G. Woodson settled in Washington, D.C. where he taught in the segregated black schools of the Nation\u2019s Capital, published his first works on the history of black education, and founded the Association for the Study of Negro Life and History in 1915. As Director of the Association, Dr. Woodson launched a celebration of Negro History Week in 1926. He chose the second week of February to commemorate the birthdays of Frederick Douglass and Abraham Lincoln.  The annual week-long celebration was expanded into Black History Month in 1976.",

Fields\nQuote By: \tMark Bollinger\n\t\nCompany Towns:\tYou live in a company house. You go to a company school.\nYou work for this company according to the company rules.\nYou all drink company water and all use company lights.\nThe company preacher teaches us. What the company thinks is right.\nCarl Sandburg\n\nIn the late 1800s, coal became King in West Virginia. Over a sixty-year period, hundreds of coal mines were opened throughout southern West Virginia. To dig the coal, thousands of native Appalachians, African Americans, and immigrants from Europe migrated to the coal fields to work in the mines. To support the mining operations and their workers, \u201ccoal camps\u201d became as numerous as the coal mines.  Company towns, or \u201ccoal camps\u201d as they were commonly known, were built and owned by the coal companies themselves. They provided miners and their families a place to live, a place to buy goods and services, as well as opportunities for personal and recreational activities. In 1930, there were nearly 500 coal company towns in West Virginia.\n\nThe vast majority of African Americans who migrated to southern West Virginia found new lives in coal company towns. These mining camps were favored by black migrants because jobs were there. Camps also provided available and affordable housing. The 1900 U.S. census shows that a majority of residents in many of the coal camps were African American. Black miners living and working in mining camps like Nuttallburg, Hawks Nest, and Stonecliff made up over 55 percent of the population.  \n\nThe Nuttallburg mine and company town provides a fine example of an early New River Gorge coal mining operation.  John Nuttal, an immigrant from England, purchased land along the New River and founded the Nuttallburg Coal & Coke Company. He built a company town along the north side of the New River near the mouth of Short Creek.  In 1900, most of the African American men in Nuttallburg worked in the mine. There were black workers that also worked for the railroad and in construction. One African American worked as a clerk at the company store and another was a coke yard boss. For some 85 years, the Nuttallburg mine and coal camp provided work and a way of life for many African Americans.\n\nA coal company usually purchased or leased land around the mining operation on which to construct a town. A typical coal camp consisted of the tipple, coke ovens, a company store, church, school, post office, and company-owned housing.  In 1890, there were 110 company-owned houses in Nuttallburg. Monthly rental on a simple four-room company house amounted to one or two day\u2019s wages.  A 1922 survey found that over 80 percent of West Virginia miners rented their homes from a coal company. By 1900, Nuttallburg also had a doctor\u2019s office, blacksmith shop, club houses, and recreational facilities.\n\nWhat was life like for black miners and their families living in a company town?  Interviews of former coal camp residents indicate that segregation by status, race, and ethnicity existed in the coal camps. Black and white residents lived in different neighborhoods, worshiped in separate churches, and attended segregated schools. Housing for African Americans was often located on the outskirts of the camp or in a different hollow all together. In Nuttallburg, Short Creek divided the town. African Americans lived on the east side of the creek; white residents lived on the west side. Both communities had their own school, church, and clubhouses. \n\nIn the African American community, children attended a company school for black students. These schools typically went from first to eighth grade and ran five to six months a year. Students old enough to attend high school rode the train or bus to the closest town that had a black high school.  The church was an important part of the African American community in the coal camps. It offered both spiritual and social activities weekly and throughout the year. Most residents were Baptists or Methodist who enthusiastically participated in church services and events. \n\nWhen not working in the mines, black miners and their families enjoyed a variety of leisure and recreational activities within their community. Hunting and fishing were popular. Black residents enjoyed going to the theater, club houses, dance halls, and bowling alleys. Members of the community often gathered on front porches to play their guitars, banjos, and fiddles and to sing. Many African Americans spent Sunday afternoon visiting family and friends or watching a baseball game. Baseball was the miner's favorite sport with many camps having an all-black and all-white ball team. The Sunday afternoon baseball game was a major social event in the black community.\n\nDuring the 1950s, life in the coal camp began to change dramatically. As mechanization of the mines increased, more and more miners lost their jobs. It was often the black miner",

                        "audioTranscript": "The Hawk\u2019s Nest Tunnel Disaster\nWritten by:\tMark Bollinger\nNarrated by:\tJoshua Flynn\n\nThroughout the years, West Virginia has suffered many a tragedy that left hundreds of workers injured or dead. These tragedies are the result of disasters occurring in our coal mines, on our railroads and at industrial facilities like the Hawk\u2019s Nest Tunnel. This disaster became one of the worst industrial tragedies in the history of the United States.\n\nIn 1930, construction began on a three-mile tunnel through Gauley Mountain located between Ansted and Gauley Bridge, West Virginia. When finished, the Hawk\u2019s Nest Tunnel would divert water from the New River to a hydroelectric plant downstream. The water would be used to produce electricity for Union Carbide\u2019s plant at Alloy, West Virginia. In order to build the tunnel through solid rock, hundreds of unemployed men were recruited for construction jobs on the project. At least two-thirds of these workers were African Americans.\n\nAs the men drilled and blasted a 32-36 inch tunnel through the mountain, they drilled through rock that contained high levels of silica. The dry drilling techniques that was used released large amounts of silica dust into the air. This made working in the tunnel very dangerous. African American diggers emerged from the hole in the mountain covered with layers of white dust. The interior of the tunnel was a white cloud of silica, impairing vision and clogging the lungs of workers.\n\nBecause the Hawk\u2019s Nest Tunnel was licensed as a civil engineering project, even the most modest forms of safety were not applied. Workers labored in confined spaces with poor ventilation, a lack of dust control, and limited use of personal breathing protection. Within months, workers became sick from breathing silica dust. They showed signs of a lung disease called silicosis but were treated for a new disease called \u201ctunnelitis\u201d. Silicosis is a disease that inpairs the lungs leading to a shortness of breath and eventually death. Silicosis cannot be cured.\n\nThe length of employment in the tunnel rarely lasted more than a year. The dangerous work conditions and silica dust rendered many of the men unable to work. Excavation of the Hawk\u2019s Nest Tunnel lead to the greatest death toll ever from silicosis in the United States. Of the approximately 5,000 men that worked on the project; an estimated 2,900 worked inside the tunnel. At least 764 of these men died of silicosis. A majority of the dead were African Americans. In the years after the project was completed, many more would die due to their exposure to silica dust while working in the tunnel.\n\nWith the death of so many black workers, the problem of where to bury them became an issue. There were a limited number of burial sites for blacks nearby. To solve the issue, a funeral parlor in Summersville, West Virginia located an open field on Martha White\u2019s farm. This field became the burial grounds for many of the African Americans who died working on the tunnel project. Owen Symes a local resident remembers the cemetery like this:\n\n\u201cI used to rabbit hunt over there on the Martha White farm out in the fields before Rt. 19 came through here. I could see the graves. They were little soft mounds of dirt with grass over them. If you were not careful, you could step on one and it would cave in. They were in rows right up and down the fence line. They moved a lot of them when the highway came through. Dug up the graves and took what was left down by Hughes Bridge on the Gauley River to bury them again.\" \n \nToday, the tunnel continues diverting water from the New River to produce hydro-electricity for the Alloy plant. Silicosis has been designated as an occupational disease with compensation for workers. However, tunnel workers at Hawk\u2019s Nest were not protected by these laws. This memorial on Highway 19 was established to remember and honor the many victims of the Hawk\u2019s Nest Tunnel tragedy.",

                        "audioTranscript": "Mount Chapel Missionary Baptist Church\nWritten by:\tDr. Brucella Jordan\nNarrated by:\tDr. Brucella Jordan\n    \nIn 1865, when enslaved Africans were emancipated from slavery in America, they faced the immediate challenge of creating their own communities. African Americans had descended from a rich religious and spiritual West African tradition, and were then exposed to Christianity during enslavement. Consequently, securing a place to worship consistently became, and has remained, a part of African American community development since Reconstruction.   \n\nAlthough African Americans in the region of Ansted, West Virginia were few in number throughout the antebellum/agrarian era, their numbers increased after West Virginia achieved statehood in 1863. Black workers became a necessary labor force during the initial years of West Virginia industrialization. The first African American industrial workers were employed in the region in the early 1870s with the construction of a branch of the C&O Railway and the opening of the Gauley-Kanawha Coal Company in Hawk\u2019s Nest.    In 1889, entrepreneurs and investors dissolved that company and created the Gauley Mountain Coal Company (GMCC), shifting coal mining from Hawk\u2019s Nest to nearby Ansted.  Ansted was incorporated in 1891.\n\nWhereas African American presence had been miniscule, the demands of coal mines and coke ovens prompted a steady increase in the number of black workers and residents.  Consistent with the traditional establishment of African American communities, Ansted residents soon began to address their religious and spiritual needs by congregating in homes for prayer meetings. In October of 1891, a revival took place and approximately twenty candidates were received for baptism. State Missionary Reverend Coleman agreed to administer baptism and organize a church.   The community soon petitioned the Gauley Mountain Coal Company to construct a church building. The congregation accepted the responsibility of paying $75 for labor, and Mount Chapel Missionary Baptist Church was constructed. A stipulation was that the building would revert back to coal company property once the church ceased to exist.   A cemetery was opened in 1893. \n     \nDue to the prevalence of churches in the New River region and the dearth of ministers to pastor those churches, it became customary for ministers to officiate at more than one church. Initially, Mount Chapel Baptist Church held church service only on the third Sunday of each month. Eventually, there was both a service and Sunday school on the first and third Sundays.\n\nAs in many African American communities, the Ansted African American church became the center of the community\u2019s existence. Most African American residents of Ansted were church members, and it was through the church that many of their cultural, individual, and family needs were met. The minister\u2019s message, soul-stirring spirituals, and biblical teachings provided inspiration and guidelines for daily life. Church members could be counted on to help celebrate births, weddings, and baptisms, as well as to give support and comfort when deaths or other tragedies occurred. Church related activities involved residents in special projects and recreational pursuits. In addition to Sunday services, there were prayer meetings, Bible study, revivals, church operating and planning meetings. Annual affairs included homecoming, the pastor\u2019s anniversary, picnics, and gospel sings. Mount Chapel Missionary Baptist Church, the sole African American religious institution in Ansted, served not only an important religious function, but also a social function.   \n\nWhile the Gauley Mountain Coal Company defined the economic expression of the Ansted community, Mount Chapel Missionary Baptist Church defined spiritual beliefs that influenced the attitudes and actions of its African American citizens.",

                        "audioTranscript": "African Americans and the Railroad\nWritten by:\tRichard Altare\nNarrated by:\tAdrienne Jenkins\n\nConstruction of railroads and stations brought thousands of people to the coal-rich region of Appalachia. Three railroads opened the vast coalfields of Southern West Virginia to mining: the Chesapeake & Ohio Railway along the New and Kanawha rivers, the Norfolk & Western Railway through the Pocahontas coalfield, and the Virginian Railway into the Winding Gulf fields. This meant jobs building and maintaining the railroads as well as jobs in the coal mines. Jobs in these industries provided the opportunity for African American families to escape the \u201cJim Crow\u201d segregated society of the Deep South. African American men were able to build new lives as vital, more respected, and better-paid workers.\n   \nAfrican Americans made up the majority of workers whose sweat, muscle, and blood carved the C&O Railway, its branch lines, and other railroads through the mountainous landscapes. Constructed between 1869 and 1873, it employed thousands of black laborers. Journalist Jedidiah Hotchkiss wrote about black railroad workers in 1873, \n\nThey have proved in fact to be fine laborers, both as track-makers, and for mining, blasting, and all the other work of railroad building. They lived in shanties along the road, wherever their work lay \u2026  It [the road] was built almost entirely by the labor of negroes, who here proved themselves admirable and trustworthy workmen; sober, equal to the severest toil, and winning the good opinion of everyone. These blacks, of whom five thousand were employed on the road, [were] all formerly slaves in Eastern Virginia \u2026\u201d\n\nAfter construction was completed, the depot and rail yard here at Gauley Bridge, as at other towns along the rails, continued to provide black workers with steady jobs. Maintaining the tracks was called \u201clining track.\u201d It was a daily, hard-labor \u2013 a never-ending task primarily accomplished by black work crews. Often known as \u201cgandy dancers\u201d these men used songs and rhythm as a choreographed team. They aligned the track with precision, placing heavy wooden ties and steel rails, and driving in spikes. \n\nEach C&O rail yard, engine house, roundhouse, and depot required other workers to operate and maintain the massive coal- and water-powered steam locomotives as well as the coal, freight, and passenger cars. African Americans were employed as train porters, freight handlers, switch tenders, and engine shop workers.  \n\nFollowing the Civil War, George Pullman established the Pullman Sleeping Car Company. Pullman sleeper cars were contracted out to all the passenger railways in the United States and the porters hired to staff the sleepers were exclusively black. The Pullman Company grew to be the largest single employer of African Americans in the nation. In 1925, Pullman porters formed the first all-black union, the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters.\n\nAlthough the railroad provided employment opportunities for many African Americans, these jobs often required the hardest work while providing the lowest pay. Even with these challenges and the limitations of a segregated society, African American railroad men worked hard to provide for their families, and built strong black communities through church, school, and civic organizations.",

                        "audioTranscript": "African American Fraternal Organizations\nWritten by:\tDr. Brucella Jordan\nNarrated by:\tJoshua Flynn\n\n\nAfrican American fraternal organizations, like Bright Hope Lodge #9 here in Montgomery, WV began as a means of meeting the economic and social needs of the African American community. They shaped African American identity through rituals of brotherhood and protected members against poverty and other hardships. Although fraternal organizations originated in free black communities before the Civil War, thousands were founded during Reconstruction.\n\nFraternal organizations for black and white residents began before governmental aid and other assistance programs existed for the poor. Segregation and discriminatory practices made obtaining what little help that was available even more difficult for African Americans. African American fraternal organizations became a back-up plan for their communities. By collecting membership dues, they were able to aid the poor, the unemployed, orphanages, and widows, often providing burial funds.\n\nThe first black Masonic Lodge was founded by Prince Hall and fifteen black men in Boston, Massachusetts.  Their 1874 request for permission from white American Lodge members to establish a chapter of black Masons was denied.  In 1887, however, their petition to the Grand Lodge of England, where white American fraternal orders had originated, was honored and a charter was granted.\n\nThe influx of African Americans recruited into West Virginia in the late 19th and early 20th centuries brought a consistent increase in the formation of African American fraternal organizations. Steady employment on railroads and in coal mines made it easier for workers to pay dues in fraternal societies. Their membership brought a sense of unity and provided a social outlet for them and their families.\n\nBright Hope Lodge was organized on January 22, 1889 in Coal Valley, Fayette County. Coal Valley later became Montgomery, West Virginia. The official name was Bright Hope Lodge #12 and meetings were held in the first Lodge Hall, built on Third Avenue in 1890. The Lodge experienced significant growth in the 1890s and the early years of 1900; however, the Great Depression brought a decline in membership.  A merger of lodges in 1946 gave rise to Bright Hope Lodge # 9.  This transformation took place under the leadership of Worshipful Master Joseph R. Lawrence, Sr.   The current Lodge Hall was built in 1962.  Membership dues and fundraising activities continue to sustain the organization, support lodge functions, and address community needs.\n\nThe sister organization of Bright Hope Lodge # 9 is Naomi Chapter # 10 Order of the Eastern Star. It was established in 1920.  At that time they operated under the leadership of Lucy Hodge, the first Worthy Matron and Andrew Slaughter, the first Worthy Patron.  Working in conjunction with their Lodge brothers, they support and participate in functions and events within the organization and the overall community.  \n     \nBright Hope Lodge # 9 and Naomi Chapter #10 have created positive role models for African American males and females, promoted African American heritage and culture, instilled spiritual ideals, and served as an example of unity and strength. The organization has awarded scholarships to deserving students, provided food for the needy, worked with senior citizen and domestic violence programs, and supported NAACP initiatives and research projects associated with health issues. In the process of creating social connections for themselves and helping others, the organization has gained significant respect and support from community residents, businesses, and legislators of Fayette County.",

                        "audioTranscript": "The Community of Harlem Heights\nWritten by:\tDr. Brucella Jordan\nNarrated by:\tDr. Brucella Jordan and Adrienne Jenkins (quote)\n\n\nHarlem Heights is an atypical African American community located within the City of Oak Hill, West Virginia.  While most African American communities in the New River area were coal mining or industrially-based, the residents of Harlem Heights had a variety of occupations.  In addition, the residents of coal mining towns usually lived in company houses, but most residents of Harlem Heights were homeowners.     \n\nIn the Harlem Heights area, the Homeseekers Land and Building Company charged \u201cvery little for lots.\u201d This allowed African Americans to be able to purchase land and build a home.  In what was basically an open field, African Americans began building homes and establishing a community.  Jessie Barret a resident of the neighborhood notes; \n\n\u201c[Harlem Heights] had five black families when I moved there in 1942.  The remainder of the area was farm land.  The section they called Harlem Heights had actually three streets. Lincoln Street, High Street, and Lewis [street].  [At that time] everything was inaccessible. We had the old fashioned outhouse for quite a while. We had about two wells with this huge long bucket you draw with.  We had to carry our water [and] catch rain water for laundry.  We had it rough for about a couple of years.\u201d        \n\nAs the community began to develop; paved roads replaced dirt roads. Residents acquired indoor toilets and running water as well as other amenities and services.  As the population grew, the community needed a school. In 1947, the Harlem Heights School was built and accommodated students in the first through eighth grade. High school students were bused seven miles to DuBois High School in Mount Hope, West Virginia. When schools were integrated in the 1960s, Harlem Heights students began attending the white elementary schools and Collins High School in Oak Hill. The school at Harlem Heights closed its doors in 1967.   \n\nHarlem Heights residents held a variety of occupations. Several were entrepreneurs who owned and operated stores and businesses right in the community.  Resident Terrance Tango Leggett remembers Ms. Classy\u2019s store, later known as Shug\u2019s Place, where residents could purchase necessities. Down the street was Mr. Bozo\u2019s store, with a dance hall on the second level.  Other residents worked as teachers, mining inspectors, seamstresses, and ministers. A few made their living as farmers. Sterling Hughes raised cattle and sold milk, cheese, butter, eggs and homemade hot dinner rolls from his farm. Some residents, especially women, held service- oriented jobs.  Of course, there were a few coal miners, but they did not represent the majority of residents.   \n\nThe people of Harlem Heights took pride in their community by keeping it clean and attractive. They actively supported their churches, civic clubs, and fraternal organizations. Some residents worked as community activists to move their neighborhood forward.  In the 1970s, Social worker Opal Leggett was responsible for starting and overseeing the Head Start program in Fayette County. Fayette County Legislators, Diane Smallwood and Reverend Frank Robinson as well as the honorable William Robinson were active as political organizers and community developers.   A neighborhood park was built in honor of Federal mine inspector Russell E. Mathews acknowledging his impact in the community. \n\nThrough all of these efforts, Harlem Heights grew to become a rather upscale African American community. Though relatively small, it grew large enough and politically active enough to have its own voting precinct. Today, the community has a Masonic lodge and three churches:  The Community Baptist Church, The First Baptist Church, and The Glorious Church of God in Christ.",

The Italians, Irish, African Americans and others who filled these jobs were subjected to hard physical labor, and dangerous work conditions. Work-related injuries and even death were hazards of the job. Injuries occurred almost-daily. Medical care and services were sparse and unavailable in most railroad towns and coal camps. Injured workers had to depend on home remedies. Some injuries led to disabilities, resulting in the worker losing his job and his family being evicted from their company-owned house.\n\nIn 1899, the State of West Virginia provided and improved medical care for both the working man and the general public. The State Legislature passed an act establishing three \u201cminer\u2019s\u201d hospitals within the state. Originally called Miner\u2019s Hospitals One, Two, and Three, they eventually took the name of the town where they were located. Miner\u2019s Hospital # 1 was built in the Town of Welch in the southern coal fields. Hospital # 3 served the northern coal fields and was located in Fairmont, WV. Hospital # 2 was constructed in the heart of the New River Coal Field. It became known as the McKendree Hospital. \n\nThe McKendree Miner\u2019s Hospital opened in 1901. It was built on land donated by New River coal operator Colonel Joseph Beury. The hospital provided free medical treatment for coal miners and railroad workers. All other patients were charged $1.59 a day for medical treatment. A whites-only nurse training program was established in 1901 to provide better qualified nursing staff at the hospitals. \n\nSeemingly isolated deep in the New River Gorge, the hospital was actually very accessible to people living throughout the region. The hospital was linked to each town and community by the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway and its branch lines. The railroad was the \u201cambulance\u201d service for workers and their families. A former nurse trainee, Thelma Louise Cashion, reflects back on her time working at the hospital\u2026\n\n\u201cThe hospital was almost always full of patients. Patients were divided into different wards. There were large White and Black male wards and smaller White and Black female wards. There were integrated private rooms available for the women and their babies who were delivered there. Most of the patients by far were men with very serious and traumatic injuries including cuts and crushed limbs requiring amputations and burns. In 1933, the hospital was inundated with patients during a typhoid fever epidemic.\u201d\n\nMcKendree Hospital closed as a medical facility in the 1940s due to its remote location and the closure of mines within the gorge. However, it continued to operate as a segregated nursing home for elderly black men and women. A decade later, the doors closed for good. The other two \u201cminers\u201d hospitals remained opened until the mid-1980s.  \n\nOver the years, the McKendree Hospital was slowly demolished, its bricks and building materials removed for reuse.  Today, the only access to the hospital site is along a very rugged road and hike through the forest. Like most of the coal towns of the once booming New River coal fields, the McKendree Hospital has been reclaimed by nature.",

In West Virginia, school segregation was mandated by the State Constitution. West Virginia was one of seventeen states that had a dual school system; schools for white students and schools for African American students. At the time of the decision, there were 420,000 white and 26,000 black students attending school in West Virginia.1 African American students were not receiving an equal education. They were using outdated, second-hand books as well as band and school equipment passed down from white high schools. \n\nThe ruling did not come with specific recommendations; desegregation was left up to the individual states and often to the individual county school systems. By June of 1954, the institutes of higher learning in West Virginia had begun the process of desegregation. By September, twenty-nine of the forty-six West Virginia counties with African American students had also begun the process of integrating their K-12th grade schools. \n\nSome counties were reluctant and slow to integrate their schools. A few remained segregated until the mid-1960s. Other school systems maintained their dual school system allowing black students to attend an integrated school or continue to attend an all-black school. In most counties, desegregation went fairly smoothly; however, there were students and parents who protested against integration or boycotted efforts to integrate. None of these activities led to major violence. \n\nIn Fayette County, school officials announced that all schools would be integrated at the beginning of the 1956-57 school year. Here in Mount Hope, the older white high school was converted to a middle school. The white students were moved to the all-black DuBois High School which was the newer and nicer of the two high school buildings. DuBois was renamed Mount Hope High School. \n\nThe results of integration affected each person differently. African American principals before desegregation were demoted to teachers after integration. Many black teachers were the first to lose their jobs if there were not enough teaching positions at the combined schools. In some integrated schools, male black students were allowed to play on the football and basketball teams, but they could not play other team sports. African American girls were not allowed to be on the cheerleading squad. Throughout the region, black students were treated differently. At some schools they could not participate in the band or chorus, or join white-only school clubs and organizations; at others schools they could.\n\nArtifacts, trophies, yearbooks, and records from many of the black high schools were burned or placed away in boxes and forgotten. Kathleen Scott attended the segregated DuBois High School. For her, the most significant effect of integration was losing many of her friends who lived in more distant communities. \u201cOur friends from other parts of the county began going to high schools closer to where they lived,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd we didn\u2019t get to see them anymore.\u201d It took West Virginia school districts almost a decade to become fully desegregated, and the closing of the African American schools resulted in a loss of community identity for black residents.",

Fields\nSong: \t\t\u201cThose Who Came Before\u201d by Lady D.\n\n\u201c\u201dThose Who Came Before,\u201d was written and performed by me, Lady D. It tells of my days growing up in West Virginia. Over the years, musicians like myself, Bill Withers, The Swan Silvertones, and many others have kept the essence of African American music alive in West Virginia and the nation.\u201d \n\u201cI was born in Kayford, WV. They call me West Virginia\u2019s First Lady of Soul. I am a singer, song writer, and actress, and I perform a variety of soul, blues, jazz, and gospel songs.\"\nBill Withers, famous for his songs, \u201cLean on Me\u201d and \u201cAin\u2019t No Sunshine,\u201d was born in Slab Fork, WV, the youngest of six children. Bill reflects back on his childhood, \u201cWe lived right on the border of the Black and White neighborhood. I heard guys playing country music and in church I heard gospel. There was music everywhere.\u201d His song, \u201cLean on Me,\u201d tells about families and neighbors relying on one another during hard times in West Virginia.\nThe Swan Silvertones, an African American gospel group, was formed in 1938 by Claude Jeter, a West Virginia coal miner. Known for their sweet harmonic sound with soulful vocals, the group recorded over 100 titles, its most famous being \u201cMary Don\u2019t You Wait\u201d in 1959.\n\nOne of the greatest influences on American music has been the African rhythms and melodies that came to America with enslaved people. Though the years, the blending of these rhythms and melodies with those from Europe formed new and distinct musical sounds. Today we know these sounds as gospel, ragtime, soul, blues, jazz, and old-time country music. \n\nDuring the years of enslavement, African Americans developed songs of work and songs of worship using the rhythms and melodies carried over from Africa. Known as \u201cNegro spirituals,\u201d they expressed the longing of enslaved people for spiritual and bodily freedom, for safety from harm and evil, and for relief from the hardships of enslavement.1 By the 1870s, spirituals began to be seen as music that revealed the beauty and depth of African American culture.2 In the early 1900s, the performance of \u201cNegro spirituals\u201d became a tradition among black singers.3\nAs African Americans migrated to West Virginia, they brought with them a diverse musical culture passed down from their enslaved ancestors. As they settled into the coal camps and railroad towns, the black community continued to cultivate its rich musical heritage, using oral musical traditions to pass stories and experiences down through generations. \nGifted singers within the black community could be counted on to improvise four-part harmony for the gospel hymns on Sunday morning.4 During the week, African Americans continued to express themselves through a variety of work songs like those used to synchronize the work of railroad track liners.5 Rhythms and melodies were also passed from generation to  generation. Many black musicians were self-taught, while others learned as apprentices from the best fiddle player or banjo picker in the community. \nMany types of music were enjoyed as part of African American life in company towns. One of the most important was \u201cThe Blues.\u201d The Blues, like the spiritual, is a product of slavery developed from African American work songs and European American folk music.6 Other varieties of music included string bands, gospel, quartets, and jazz. In the 1930s, big band jazz and dance music came to West Virginia; it was form of musical entertainment enjoyed by black mountaineers. Generally, music was played simply for enjoyment and relaxation. It was performed by musicians and singers who may have dug coal side-by-side during the day and then performed together at their neighbor\u2019s house in the evening.",

                        "audioTranscript": "African American Coal Miners\nWritten By:\tMark Bollinger\nNarrated By:\tDoris A. Fields\nQuote By:\tXavier Oglesby\n\nBetween 1870 and 1930, thousands of white people, African Americans, and European immigrants came to West Virginia to work in the coal mines. African Americans migrated to mines throughout the State, but most of them came to work in the smokeless coal fields of Southern West Virginia. What they found was the opportunity to build a better life for themselves and their families. By 1909, African Americans made up over 26 percent of West Virginia mine workers.\n\nIn the mines, unskilled labor was in great demand. Many of the unskilled jobs-- coal loaders, mule handlers, and coke oven workers-- were filled by African Americans. About 75 percent of all black miners became coal loaders. African Americans preferred coal loading because it allowed them to simply leave the mine when they had loaded enough coal for the day. Coal loading also offered less direct supervision. Black miners usually did not see a foreman more than once during an entire shift. This was an important consideration for Blacks who came to the mines to escape the constant scrutiny of white people in the Jim Crow South.\n\nPicking and loading coal was hard, dangerous, back-breaking work; however, it provided the greatest opportunity for the miner to earn good money. As coal loaders, black and white miners were paid by the ton of coal mined, not by the hours worked. Hard-working miners could cut and load an average of five tons of coal daily, earning $2.20 to $5.00 per day.  Today, a West Virginia miner earns an average of $325.00 for an eight-hour day. \n\nFor nearly sixty years, coal was mined by hand using a pick, a drill, a needle, and a No. 2 and No. 4 shovel. A miner was required to purchase his tools from the company store. Once the black coal loader was underground, he performed the laborious tasks of cutting, drilling, blasting, and loading coal. William Tams\u2019s describes from his personal knowledge the job of a black coal miner. \n\u201cThe loader carried into the mine his picks, shovels, auger, tamping bar, fuse and a can of black powder. He was charged fifth cents per month for the services of the company blacksmith in re-sharpening and tempering the pick \u2026. After taking two and a half to three hours to make an undercut, the miners drilled, loaded, and fired the holes, bringing down the undercut coal. They then pushed up empty mine cars from the room mouth, loaded them, and returned them to the entry\u2026. The miner put his brass check near the bottom of each car he loaded. The check was removed after the car was dumped at the tipple and the load credited to the proper man.\u201d\n\nTo make an undercut, the miner had to lie on his side, wedged part way under the ledge of coal in order to make a four to six foot cut along the base of the coal seam. Undercutting the coal allowed it to fall to the mine floor when the coal was blasted. The miner then drilled holes into the face of the coal using a mechanical crank breast auger. Black powder, purchased by the miner, was rolled into paper cartridges and inserted into the drilled hole. The miner then inserted a long, thin, copper rod called a \u201cneedle\u201d into the hole. The blasting hole was then carefully tamped with clay mud and the needle extracted. A fuse was inserted into the cavity left from the needle. When the miner was ready to blast the coal, he shouted \u201cfire in the hole\u201d three times to warn fellow miners. The fuse was lit and the miner retreated to the nearest cross-cut for cover. If the powder was tamped and charged correctly, an ear-popping blast would bring the entire cut down to the mine floor.   \n\nOnce the dust settled, the miner began the laborious task of loading the coal into cars. It was critical that the miner load only clean coal because he was not paid for loading rock. When the car was full, he pushed it to the mouth of his room where it was hauled away to the head house. Before the miner could start a new cut, he had to perform \u201cdead work\u201d for which he received no pay.  Dead work involved installing roof supports, maintaining ventilation, and extending the tramway to the coal face. \n\nA tramway system similar to a light-duty railroad hauled the coal to the outside. Mule drivers and their brakemen, often African Americans, hauled the loaded coal cars to the mainline. There the cars were made up into trains and hauled to the headhouse. At the headhouse, the coal was weighed and the miner credited for payment. Until the advent of electric motors at the turn of the twentieth century, mules or horses were used to pull coal cars out of the mines. From the mine, some of the coal headed to coke ovens where black workers performed the hot and laborious job of tending the ovens. They shoveled coal into the ovens, fired the coal, then unloaded the finished coke into train cars, earning an average of $1.60 per day.",

                        "audioTranscript": "Early African American Education in West Virginia\nWritten by:\tMark Bollinger\nNarrated by:\tJoshua Flynn\n\nIn the colonial and antebellum years of the United States, the education of African Americans was mainly provided by missionary and charitable organizations. Most slaveholders were fearful that an educated enslaved population would threaten their authority, spread abolitionist materials, and lead to insurrections. Southern states, including Virginia in 1819, passed laws prohibiting the education of enslaved people and free black people. These laws prohibiting the teaching of African Americans remained in effect until 1863 when West Virginia was carved out of the western portion of Virginia.\n\nThe adoption of West Virginia\u2019s Constitution in 1863 provided for the establishment of state schools, but made no references to the education of African Americans. Three years later, the Legislature passed a bill providing public schools for African Americans. This bill called for the establishment of black schools in sub-districts containing at least thirty black children between the ages of six and twenty-one. They had to maintain an average attendance of fifteen students, or face closure. The law was eventually amended to allow the establishment of schools in districts whenever there were at least ten black children of school age.  An 1872 revision of the State Constitution stipulated that white and black students should not be taught in the same school.\n\nIn 1866, the first public school for Black students was established in Parkersburg. The following year, Storer College in Harpers Ferry opened as the only school in the State where black youth could receive academic and normal training. Storer College offered courses in gardening, animal husbandry, sewing, instrumental music, cookery, blacksmithing and teaching. Its\u2019 graduates were some of the first African Americans to become teachers in West Virginia\u2019s black schools. The State Legislature eventually established the West Virginia Colored Institute\u2014now West Virginia State University\u2014in 1891. The Bluefield Colored Institute, now Bluefield State University, followed four years later. Both institutions provided teacher training.\n\nThe need for African American teachers increased drastically in the late 1800s with the opening of coal fields in the southern part of the state. The coal industry attracted large numbers of African Americans seeking good- paying jobs in the mines and better education for their children. Population in the southern West Virginia counties boomed. By 1906, there were 9,874 black students attending school in the state, the majority in Fayette, McDowell, Kanawha, Greenbrier, and Mercer counties. Black schools included 219 common, 42 grade schools, and 5 high schools and employed 310 African American teachers. These teachers were paid an average annual salary of $231.00, the same as white teachers at the time.\n\nThe first school for African Americans in Raleigh County was a one-room log structure built on Mills Branch in 1873. In nearby Summers County, the first black school was opened in 1878 with 15 pupils. Two years later, the first school for African American students in Fayette County was established at Quinnimont. These small community schools provided education only through the eighth grade, and for a school term of four to five months. Black students who were able to attend high school had to travel by train to larger population areas where an all-black high school existed.  Among the first African American high schools in the region were Stratton in Raleigh County, DuBois in Fayette County, and Lincoln in Summers County.\n\nStratton High School was established in 1918 over three centuries after the first black enslaved people arrived in Virginia in 1619. Stratton began as a two-room structure with nearly 80 students. In 1938, a two-story brick building with a gymnasium and auditorium was constructed. Considered the most up-to-date black high school in the state, it operated until 1967, when its students were integrated into the all-white Woodrow Wilson High School. Today, the building houses Stratton Elementary School.",

Many of these men were African Americans who migrated to West Virginia in search of jobs. Jobs on the railroad were labor intensive and low paying, required long hours, and were at times dangerous. \n\nRailroad workers primarily used shovels, wheelbarrows, mules, and black powder to move millions of tons of rock and dirt to prepare the railroad bed. Workers used axe and adz to cut and shape hundreds of trees into ties, bridge timbers, and lumber for railcars. They sweated in the hot summer sun and froze in the cold mountain winters as they worked to connect Tidewater Virginia with the Ohio Valley.\n\nAs the C&O Railway stretched westward along the Greenbrier River, The Legend of John Henry was born at Big Bend Mountain near Talcott, West Virginia. The Legend of John Henry is just that, a \u201clegend,\u201d and through the legend, John Henry became a symbol. He symbolized the many African Americans whose sweat and hard work built and maintained the rails across West Virginia. He was a symbol for the black workers who gave their lives in these dangerous occupations. The legend, as told through ballads and work songs, has kept the story of John Henry and the black railroad workers alive. \n\nIn February of 1870, workers began drilling the Great Bend Tunnel where the Greenbrier River makes a seven-mile meander around Big Bend Mountain. Over 800 men, many of them African American, cut a 6,450 foot-long tunnel through the mountain. The workers cut through layers of red shale, which tended to disintegrate when exposed to air, making the tunnel a dangerous place to work. Rock falls were common and death was always a possibility. At nearly a mile and one quarter long, the Great Bend Tunnel is the longest on the C&O Railway.\n\nThe process of building a tunnel in the 1870s was slow and difficult work. Holes were drilled into the layers of rock using a hand drill and hammer. Holes were then filled with powder and blasted in order to make the rock small enough to remove from the tunnel. The drill was held by a \u201cshaker\u201d who turned it slightly after each blow and gave it a shake to flip the rock dust out of the hole.  The \u201csteel driver\u201d swung the hammer as hard and as often as he could, pounding the drill into the rock. \n\nAs the story goes, John Henry was hired as a steel driver for the railroad. Later, the railroad company brought in a steam drill to speed up work on the tunnel. It was said that the steam drill could drill faster than any man. The challenge was on, \u201cman against machine.\u201d John Henry was known as the strongest, the fastest, and the most powerful man working on the railroad. He went up against the steam drill to prove that the black worker could drill a hole through the rock farther and faster than the drill could. Using two 10-pound hammers, one in each hand, he pounded the drill so fast and so hard that he drilled a 14-foot hole into the rock. The legend says that the drill was only able to drill nine feet. John Henry beat the steam drill and later died of exhaustion. \n\nThe Great Bend Tunnel was completed on September 12, 1872, and remained in service until 1974. The tunnel and the man have been cemented into the annals of time through The Ballad of John Henry. The song tells of a boy born with a \"hammer in his hand.\u201d It tells of a man who worked as a steel driver during the construction of the Great Bend Tunnel. It tells us that this man took a hammer in each hand to face down a steam-powered drilling machine. John Henry promised, \"If I can't beat this steam drill down, I'll die with this hammer in my hand!\" At the Great Bend Tunnel, John Henry became one of the world\u2019s great folk heroes.",

                        "audioTranscript": "Segregation of African Americans\nWritten by:\tMichael Burk\nNarrated by:\tJoshua Flynn\n\nAfrican Americans living in West Virginia after the Civil War experienced an unusual social and racial environment. From the 1870s through the 1950s, thousands of African Americans migrated to the state in search of jobs. Upon their arrival, they were met with segregation and discrimination, but also with economic, political, and educational opportunities that had been denied them in other southern states. They preferred West Virginia because it provided them the right to vote and educate their children. \n\nThey came to live in communities which were not suppressed by racist politics and the constraints of Jim Crow laws. Just across the state line in Virginia, Jim Crow laws forced African Americans to use segregated transportation and granted them no voting rights. In West Virginia, African Americans were able to send their children to publicly-funded schools. They could ride on the same bus as white people. They were able to participate in local politics. Through their vote, they were able to elect African Americans to local school boards, law enforcement offices, city councils, and the state legislature.\n\nSegregation and racism was present in other ways. It existed in coal camps and railroad towns, in the mines, and on the railroad. Black and white residents lived in different neighborhoods, worshiped in separate churches, and attended segregated schools. Many towns had a \u201cwhite neighborhood\u201d and a \u201cblack neighborhood\u201d that separated where residents lived. Housing for African Americans was often inferior and located in the less desirable part of town. The section of town where black residents lived was on the far end of town away from the company store and other amenities. Helen Powell relates that in the Collins Hill area of Glen Jean, the \u201cblack section\u201d did not have running water like the \u201cwhite section\u201d did. \n\nAfrican American workers faced racism on the job as well. On the railroad, there were white-only jobs, the engineers, conductors, and supervisors. Black workers did jobs that included porters, baggage handlers, and track crews. In the mines, Whites were almost exclusively hired as supervisors, fire bosses, and motormen.  African Americans were hired into jobs as coal loaders and mule handlers which were more labor intensive positions. Even though segregation prevailed, black miners were offered the same type of housing, rental rates, and equal wages as white miners. Black and white miners typically intermingled while eating lunch, gathering their equipment, and riding shaft elevators and underground rail cars. However, they showered and changed in segregated bath houses and went home to separate neighborhoods. \n\nAfrican Americans were also subjected to segregation in seeing a movie, eating at a restaurant, attending school, or staying at a hotel. There were hotels for white patrons and hotels for black patrons. At the theater, black movie goers had to sit in the balcony or in areas away from the white movie goers. African Americans were provided separate company-owned recreation facilities. One gentleman recalls: \n\n\u201cOur communities were segregated and I lived in a small coal camp. We grew up basically playing ball together every day. We used to have segregated competitions a lot of times. The Blacks would play the Whites in a Sunday afternoon football game. All of us would meet down at the ball field at two o clock and the Blacks would play the Whites.\n\nAfrican-American life was shaped by more than segregation and discrimination. Black people drew on their cultural traditions and their power at the ballot box to create strong communities. They invested in their churches, fraternal and professional organizations and communities. These provided a sense of belonging, opportunities for leadership, and means for spiritual and material improvement. Schools became vital institutions in the African-American community. They did more than educate and socialize black children. They provided leadership and social opportunities for both students and adults within the African American community. Although black and white residents lived in separate neighborhoods and patronized segregated restaurants and theaters, they did work closely in the mines and sat side-by-side on public transportation.",

                        "audioTranscript": "Migration of African-Americans to WV\nWritten by:\tMark Bollinger\nNarrated by:\tAdrienne Jenkins\n\n\nIn the years before coal, West Virginia\u2019s economy was based primarily on subsistence farming and timber harvesting. Without big industry, the region was sparsely populated and the workforce was small. During the late 1800s, the construction of railroads through southern West Virginia created the need for a much larger workforce. Recruitment by the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway Company and others brought thousands of African Americans to build and maintain their railroads. As the railroads opened up the large coal fields of Central Appalachia, even more African Americans came to fill hundreds of coal mining jobs.\n\nFor a period of about sixty years, starting in 1870, African Americans migrated to West Virginia through major rail centers like Hinton. They came in search of jobs as well as economic and political opportunities denied them in other states. They also came to escape Jim Crow laws that segregated them and denied them voting rights. They came because West Virginia provided better education opportunities for their children. \n\nIn 1870, there were nearly 18,000 African Americans living in West Virginia.  By 1910, the black population had grown to over 64,000 residents and eventually reached a high of 115,000. Then came the Great Depression of the 1930s. During these years, African Americans suffered from high unemployment and hard times in West Virginia. With the advent of World War II, new technologies and mechanization transformed the coal industry. These technologies doubled coal production and vastly cut the need for manpower. Coal companies were also reluctant to train and use Blacks workers to operate the new machinery. This lead to substantial layoffs of black coal miners. The result of these events stimulated a massive out-migration by African Americans in the post-war years\n\nBetween 1930 and 1980, the number of African-American coal miners fell from 22,000 to less than 1,500. By the end of the 20th century, black miners had dropped to less than three percent of West Virginia\u2019s work force. African Americans left West Virginia for the same reasons they came almost 150 years earlier, to find better jobs and economic opportunities elsewhere.",

This desert covers 110,000 square miles (280,000 sq km), an area about the size of the state of New Mexico. The Sonoran Desert is the most diverse desert in North America, home to over 4,000 species of plants and animals. Why is this place so diverse? What makes this desert different from the Great Basin\nDesert to our north, Mojave to our west or the Chihuahuan to our east? Many factors make the Sonoran Desert unique. Our winters are mostly frost-free, and there are two rainfall periods, one in the winter/spring and another in July and August. The high mountain ranges affect how much rain falls in an area, creating a diversity of habitats for specially adapted plants and animals to thrive. Everything seems to be related or connected to something else in\ncomplex ways.\n\nBased on plant evidence, scientists believe this is a young desert, only about 10,000 years old, with its ancestry in the tropics. Many of our perennial plants (cacti and other succulents) and animals\n(such as lizards and snakes) migrated from the tropics or are descendants of tropical species. They prosper in the brief summer storms that occur here. Annual plants, like many wildflowers,\nrely on the soaking winter rains that help make the Sonoran Desert so diverse. Many plants and animals in the Sonoran Desert have adapted to reproduce or grow after sufficient rainfall in winter or\nsummer. Most animals that live here are either nocturnal or crepuscular (dusk- or dawn-active) to thwart the high daytime\ntemperatures. These adaptations, along with many more, allow the Sonoran Desert life to thrive.\n\nWelcome to the Green Desert! As you travel down this road, we encourage you to travel slowly, pay attention to details, and discover some of these unique relationships for yourself.",

This olive green shrub you see all around you is one of the most drought-tolerant plants in North America. Long after the soil is too dry for most species, creosote still manages to absorb water. Its adaptations allow it to survive without water for two years before completely dying. \n\nThis supple plant sports small yellow blossoms in the spring and summer. It may occasionally bloom during other times of the year if rainfall is sufficient. The seeds are gray fuzzy balls that resemble droplets of water hanging from the branches. The waxy coating on creosote\u2019s leaves protects the plant from excessive water loss. Locals often say that the Sonoran Desert \u201csmells like rain\u201d because of the intoxicating aroma the leaves give off during a rain storm or on a foggy winter morning. \n\nCreosote is found abundantly, all over the southwest, in three deserts \u2013 the Chihuahuan, Mojave and Sonoran. It also is very long-lived, creating clonal colonies; one found in California is believed to be over 10,000 years old and is considered one of the oldest single living organisms on the planet. \n\nCreosote is useful to many desert species. The kangaroo rat likes to build its nest within the roots of the creosote bush. The seeds are a life source to many jackrabbits. The desert kit fox prefers to make its den within the roots of the creosote. Many cactus species use the\ncreosote for shelter when the cactus is young and establishing its own root system.\n\nThis unassuming shrub originated in South America but it is clearly one of the most well-adapted plants found in the monument.

It is certainly the tallest and largest cactus in the United States, growing as high as 50 feet and weighing several tons. It can live to be 200 years old. In Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument we think that these cacti flower for the first time at approximately 65 years of age and might produce their first arms at around 90. Of course there is no way to know exactly how old a saguaro is (it doesn\u2019t create growth rings like a tree). What we know comes from averaging data from hundreds of cacti all across the Sonoran Desert. Cacti living in washes or over by Tucson, where the water is more abundant, grow faster. Cacti growing in the valley flats, where water is scarce, can live their whole lives and never have the resources to support arm growth. A saguaro is entirely dependent on location and rainfall, as well as the ability of its shallow roots to suck up as much rain as possible to store in its spongy flesh. \n  \nSaguaros have adapted to the Sonoran Desert. They arrived in the region only 8,000 years ago, more recently than humans. Humans living here adapted their lives to include, even revere, the giant cactus. The Tohono O\u2019odham have strong cultural ties to the saguaro. The first saguaro fruit harvest coincides with the Tohono O\u2019odham New Year, when the summer monsoon rains fall on the parched desert floor. The O\u2019odham use woody ribs of dead saguaros to create a tool, called a ku-pit, enabling them to reach the fruit clustered at the tops of the arms and crowns of the cacti. \n  \nThe timing of the fruit ripening is impressive. Flowers appear in May and June when the desert is at its hottest and driest. The nectar is the only moisture in town, attracting important pollinators like birds and bats. The fruits ripen in July, in time for many animals to eat the delicious red fruits and transport thousands of seeds to new homes. Once the seeds are spread and the monsoon rains start, those seeds have the chance to grow into new giant saguaro. \n \nEven with all of the saguaro\u2019s adaptations to capture and conserve water, without the help of other species it would not survive here at all. It needs animals to pollinate and spread the seeds, and the assistance of other plant species to shelter young seedlings during the first fragile years of their lives. Its appearance as the master of the desert is deceiving. As you travel along what other plants dominate this habitat?",

Roosevelt and protects most of the natural habitat of the organ pipe cactus within the United States. While commonly found in the southern sections of the Sonoran Desert, these cacti are rare north of the US-Mexico border but have adapted to life in the monument. Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument experiences only a few frosty nights a year, allowing the cacti to stay warm and flourish like their Mexican neighbors. Notice how these plants to your left are standing on the south-facing slopes with little vegetation near them. Organ pipe cacti crave the sun\u2019s heat and do not require nurse plants. At night the rocks surrounding the plant release heat stored during the day, thus keeping the plants from freezing. \n \nIn June and July, flowers and fruits cover the arms of these columnar cacti. The flowers only open at night, closing for good in the early morning light to keep water loss at a minimum. These lavender-tinged white flowers emit a strong fragrance to attract lesser long-nosed bats. Each summer these bats migrate from Mexico to feast on flower nectar and the pregnant females give birth and nurse their young. They congregate at Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument, roosting within the monument\u2019s caves, buildings and historical structures, such as abandoned mines, rock shelters and old ranch houses. As summer progresses, the mothers and their babies gorge themselves on cactus fruits and distribute the seeds across the desert helping to ensure the survival of the organ pipe cactus.",

A small settlement stood on the edges of this wash, inhabited from late spring through the fall. Hohokam family-groups spent the hot dry foresummer (May, June and July) planting rows of drought-tolerant crops: corn, tepary beans and squash. Irrigation ditches were dug between the rows and down into the wash below. When the monsoon rains of August began to pour onto the parched earth, the water collected in washes and flash-flooding occurred. \n \nDams were built in strategic places to divert the floodwaters into irrigation ditches where the water would be most useful. In a months time, and with less than four inches of rain, crops would mature and produce a staple food source, without which humans could not have survived this environment. \n \nThe Tohono O\u2019odham continued these dry-land farming practices learned from their Hohokam ancestors.

Just below the ridge, the upper portion of Diablo Wash emerges from a steep canyon. Looking west from the ridge, the large, dark double summit of Twin Peaks rises above the Kris Eggle Visitor Center. The more distant craggy Cubabi Mountains to the south lie just beyond the town of Sonoyta, Mexico. Behind the Cubabis lies Reserva de la Biosfera El Pinacate y Gran Desierto de Altar or El Pinacate to the locals. This Mexican national park is the sister park to Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument, meaning the two parks work together on monitoring projects including wildlife migration, climate and weather trends, and human impacts on the park resources. \n\nAs you look across the desert, you are viewing a complex network of migratory routes for many animals that live in the Sonoran Desert. Washes just like Diablo Canyon serve as primary routes of travel for hummingbirds, coyotes and javelina. Humans have traditionally used these pathways as well. Other species, like the endangered Sonoran Pronghorn, prefer the open creosote flats. Biologists from both Organ Pipe and El Pinacate are studying wildlife migration, determining human impacts on wildlife and how the two park sites can better manage wildlife populations. State, federal and Mexican biologists have created the Sonoran Pronghorn Recovery Team, which conducts aerial surveys of pronghorn, provides support to local parklands and operates a captive breeding program. \n\nThis relationship with our sister park allows us to share information across a political boundary, collaborate efforts to protect animals like the pronghorn and to cooperate with each other in preserving and conserving two vividly different wild lands.",

Deep purple fruits called tunas are an important food in many parts of Mexico and among Native Americans. The flat pads are modified stems, functioning in the place of leaves. The prickly pear has adapted to the desert by keeping its pads straight up and thus only receiving sun on its edges, preventing sunburn under the harsh noon sun. \nThese cacti are very important to sustaining animals in the desert.

Geologists recognize this landscape as part of the vast basin and range province that includes much of the interior west of the United States and parts of northwestern Mexico as well.\n\nTo understand how this landscape was formed, we need to go back in time 25 million years when forces deep within the earth pulled the land apart. As the land was stretched, vast areas sank and formed broad valleys. These valleys were intersected by uplifted blocks of land, creating today\u2019s Ajo Range. Other mountain chains appeared one after the other as far as the eye could see. As the surface was slowly deformed, volcanoes, lava flows, and falling volcanic ash accumulated and resulted in the colorful layers of rock that are revealed all around you. \n\nThe pink and chocolate-colored rock is rhyolite, formed from solidification of a slow moving, thick lava flow. The light brown or tan rock layers, called tuff, is volcanic ash turned to stone. Over time, the mountains have been worn down and the valleys filled by rock and debris from the powerful effect of water cutting through and carrying away layers of solid rock.",

It even grows on the highest peak in the monument, Mount Ajo, which is on your left and marks the boundary between the monument and the Tohono O\u2019odham Nation. Archeologists have discovered agave-roasting pits in the high country of Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument. These pits are associated with the Hohokam who cultivated agave for ceremonial purposes. Why were the Hohokam at the top of the Ajo Range? \n\nArcheologists believe that the Hohokam tradition was to move to the high country canyons after fall harvest in the valleys. Canyons, like Estes Canyon below and to your left, served as winter homes and watchmen were located at the tops of mountains to guard the community against raiders. The Tohono O\u2019odham also used these canyons as winter homes. They were likely hunting mammals. These higher elevations also afforded a chance to catch more water. Snow and rain were more likely in the mountains. It is easy to imagine the people of the past making their way on foot up that steep rugged hill. The promise of water in dependable tinajas, natural catchments in the rock that hold rain water, were their only source of water for miles. The Hohokam and the Tohono O\u2019odham adapted to the desert by moving biannually to find food and water. Their migratory routes were always associated with tinajas, springs or other water sources and are still visible in the monument today.\n\nAhead is Estes Canyon, the midpoint of the Ajo Mountain Drive. Here you will find a ramada with picnic tables and restrooms. A loop trail leads into Estes Canyon and then climbs onto a ridge. It returns down through the foothills back to the parking area. Halfway around the loop a short spur trail climbs to Bull Pasture, which early ranchers used for their cattle. From the Bull Pasture Viewpoint hikers have a stunning view of Mount Ajo, the highest peak in the monument at 4,808 feet (1466 m). The trail, including the spur, is a fairly rugged 4.1 miles (6.6 km) round trip, with a total elevation gain of 865 feet (224 m). Ask at the Kris Eggle Visitor Center for more information.",

The fruit is high in carbohydrates and attracts many different herbivores. The mesquite adapted seed dispersal so that when seedpods were eaten in great quantities, they were dispersed across the land. Rabbits, packrats, javelina and coyote all depend on the seasonal seedpods for food. These animals, and others, help to scatter the mesquite seeds across the desert. \n\nIn the 1500s, missionaries introduced the cow, which allowed for even greater seed dispersal. Cattle no longer range in the monument but the abundance of mesquite serves as a reminder of their presence. \n\nOften called the \u201cTree of Life\u201d, many desert-dwellers owe their survival to the mesquite tree. The seeds were, and still are, ground into flour used for breads. These seeds have more protein than soybeans and were a major food source for the Tohono O\u2019odham. \n\nAnother tree that sustains life in the desert is the palo verde. With its green trunk and branches, the palo verde has a very clever way of conserving moisture. By not having leaves during the hot season, it can photosynthesize and respire (that is to create energy and breathe) through its trunk, thus conserving water. \n\nThe palo verde can also serve as a nurse tree. Saguaro seeds need shelter from a nurse plant such as a creosote or palo verde tree. These plants protect the young cactus from sunburn, torrential floods and the occasional winter frosts. Nurse trees such as the palo verde, mesquite and ironwood even fertilize the young cacti as the trees fix nitrogen from the air into the soil for themselves. The young cactus is \u201cnursed\u201d as it grows up tall and strong, spreading its shallow root system out to collect rain as it falls. This is not good news for the nurse plant. As the cactus roots spread only 3-4 inches below the surface of the soil, what started as a shelter becomes a battlefield for water. The saguaro proves victorious. Many of the monument\u2019s larger saguaros are surrounded by remains of their dead nurse trees.",

He worked with the O\u2019odham people, teaching them about cattle grazing and learning human migratory routes in return. Padre Kino\u2019s expedition mapped the region, recording invaluable water sources and ancient pathways. The expedition quickly adapted to the region, learning that trails must be near water, among high mountains and through passes. Without this knowledge, Kino\u2019s expedition and the many people that have come since would surely have perished. \n\nMany of the maps that Padre Kino created and the names he placed on them are still in use. Looking at a map of the monument today, one can immerse oneself in the history and geology of the region. Bull Pasture gets its name from the monuments\u2019 ranching era; Twin Peaks is named for its double-peaked appearance; Pinkley Peak commemorates Frank Pinkley, Superintendent of Southwestern National Monuments 1923 \u2013 1940. Behind each name is a story. \nThe Diaz Mountains are named for Captain Melchior Diaz, leader of a 15 member group in the Coronado expedition 1539-1542. In January 1541, when the expedition was close to here, Diaz suffered a freak accident and was mortally wounded. Diaz\u2019s men had no choice but to abandon any further explorations. During his fourteen months and over 3500 miles of reconnaissance on behalf of the Coronado expedition, Melchior Diaz left a valuable legacy. The information he gathered on the native peoples he encountered offers the modern reader a glimpse into a way of life prior to European contact.",

It may look as if this plant is a cactus because of its spines, but don\u2019t be fooled, it is not a cactus! This plant belongs to the Candlewood Family and is the only representative of this family in the United States. It\u2019s cousin, the boojum tree, grows mainly in Baja California, Mexico, and has been described as looking like an upside down carrot. These plants store water in their roots and stems. In drier times they shed their leaves and resemble long spiny sticks. Once the rain comes they restore just as if there was never a dry spell. Each spring leaves come out and brilliant orange-red flowers bloom at the ends of the stems. These flowers attract hummingbirds to pollinate the plant and are vital to the ocotillo\u2019s survival. The nectar found within each tubular flower is a vital energy source, crucial to the hummingbird\u2019s survival during its long and arduous migration. This mutually beneficial relationship is another example of adaptation to the desert environment. \n\nThese plants are not only beautiful but useful as well. Ocotillos are resilient and have been used for roofs and living fences by the Tohono O\u2019odham and other people in the area. When the branches are cut and planted in the ground, they often root, surviving to bloom again during the rainy seasons, creating a beautiful and useful fence or a lovely home.",

They are called chain-fruit because fruit-upon-fruit hang down, creating long chains. The joints of the plant are biologically designed to detach as an animal is walking by within its spiny reach. The spines are barbed and hook into the coat or flesh of the passer-by and the cholla joint is transported to a new location. If the conditions are favorable where it falls, the cholla joint might grow into a new plant. This cactus is sometimes referred to as a \u201cjumping cholla\u201d as the cholla joints seem to jump off the plant and attack unsuspecting passers-by. Reality is they don\u2019t jump; they are just very efficient at picking up a ride. As you can imagine, picking up these hitchhikers is painful. Adapt your habits to the desert by using caution and carrying tweezers to remove any cholla joints when you are out walking. \n\nYou may be surprised to learn that some birds will take up residence in these cacti; the spines prove some defense against desert predators. As you continue, look for cactus wren nests; they resemble football-shaped clumps of weeds with a side hole big enough for the birds to go in and out.",

They get their name because they look fuzzy and cute, but look carefully and you\u2019ll see millions of tiny hooked spines genetically designed to attach to anything that gets too close. These spines are an adaptation to the desert sun; they create shade for the cholla itself, reducing its exposure to the sun. Teddy bear cholla reproduce in the same manner as many chain-fruit cholla; by breaking off joints and rooting them into the ground. This means that all the cacti you see before you may have come from one plant that was dropped off in this area by an animal that brushed by another teddy bear cholla along his path. According to botanists, it is very possible that all the teddy bear cholla in the United States come from a single strain. \n\nPackrats will take the cholla joints to make a very protective nest called a midden. See if you can find one of these middens. Packrats have been known to make multi-story middens in wood piles or dead cacti. Some very surprising information has been uncovered from these cholla-covered homes. A midden in the Puerto Blanco Mountains records the teddy bear chollas\u2019 arrival here 10,000 years ago! This cactus migrated here when the Sonoran Desert was in its infancy and from the abundance found here at Teddy Bear Pass, it has adapted quite well.",

They built this mound over hundreds of years from the shells of oysters and clams that they harvested from the bounty of Mosquito Lagoon. As you ascend the mound you might wonder what it was used for. Was it a lookout to watch for approaching enemies? Or, was it a landmark to help them find their way back each year to their winter home. Or, was it a place for tribal ceremonies? No one really knows. We do know that the first Floridians built mounds of this type wherever they lived and that the mounds contain the remains of their lives and have many stories to tell. But as Turtle Mound is one of the last remaining intact mounds of its kind, the clues contained within help us to better understand the Timucuan's connection to the resource as we struggle to find our own. The last Timucuans passed away around 1750 or were taken to Cuba with the Spanish, taking the answers with them. But one thing we know for sure: what you will see from the top of the mound is a spectacular view of Canaveral National Seashore. Just remember, in summer, be sure you bring your insect repellant.",

                        "audioTranscript": "While walking the path from Parking Lot #8, imagine that it is the 1890s. Over one hundred people lived here then. Known as Fairview, the village had a school and a post office. Boats plied the waterway delivering supplies and picking up produce. Folks worked in the orange groves, the bee apiaries, and in vegetable gardens. They spent time with loved ones and enjoyed the bounty that the waters of the lagoon had to offer. In 1895 and 1900 there were hard freezes that killed the orange groves. Change continued with the coming of the railroad to the mainland. Boat transport was abandoned, isolating the village. Fairview became a backwater town that receded into the hammock. After 1910 Florida became popular as a wintering place for the wealthy, and Fairview became known as Eldora. Imagine wintering here with hunting, fishing, and trips to the beach by families that traveled to escape the cold northern winters: the original snowbirds. By the 1930s the Great Depression brought years of hard times, decline and neglect to Eldora. The Eldora State House, the last remaining home of this era, fell to disrepair. But her story was not over. In the the 1980s the Friends of Canaveral began a ten year restoration project. Thanks to their hard work, you can enjoy the Eldora State House in its full splendor today. Have a seat in a rocking chair on the porch, close your eyes and let yourself drift back to Eldora.",

                        "audioTranscript": "As you begin your trek over the boardwalk, be on the lookout for tracks, trails, and burrows of the animals that call the dunes home; the burrow of a gopher tortoise perhaps, or the track of a bobcat. As you walk towards the ocean you will see the vegetation change from palm and bay to palmetto scrub, then wildflowers and sea oats. If you are visiting in the winter months you may be lucky enough to spot an endangered Right Whale just offshore. Above you a Brown Pelican may be flying or diving for fish. As you look south you will see 24 miles of undeveloped beach, the longest stretch of natural coastline on the east coast of Florida. The dune system that is the backbone of the barrier island remains intact here in the seashore and changes with the winds and tides. Dunes are dynamic in that sand is brought in with the the wind and sometimes taken out with the tide. The dunes here at Canaveral change season to season and year after year. Remember it as you see it now--the next time you come back it may look completely different. In the summer months you will see yellow stakes near the dunes. These indicate the location of sea turtle nests that have been protected with screens to prevent raccoons from eating the eggs. We have over 5,000 nests along our shore each summer. You may find a treasured seashell to take home as a reminder of your trip here today. But only take those that have no one living inside.",

These are areas of differing elevations where certain plants and animals are found due to varied temperatures and levels of precipitation. The lower elevations in the Snake Valley start at about 5,000 feet, rising to the top of Wheeler Peak at just over 13,000 feet in elevation. The park is filled with life adapted to each zone and its climactic conditions.",

Salt is a corrosive agent that expands when dry and breaks apart the granitic minerals. While salt minerals do occur naturally in the granite, they are more likely transported by wind and rain from the playas of the Great Salt Lake basin, only 30 miles south of here.  \n\nAs salt eats away the interior, the case-hardened outer layer or shell erodes much slower, creating delicate arches, windows, and honeycombs.",

As the crust is stretched, high angle faults develop. Along these faults, mountains uplift and valleys drop, creating the distinctive mountain ranges.\n\nAs rocky ranges rise, the newly exposed rock is immediately subjected to weathering and erosion. This rock is attacked by water, ice, wind, and other erosive agents, that have produced many of the geologic features visible today.",

These images are rare reminders of ancient human history and that people have interacted with this landscape for thousands of years. \n\nImages on rock or rock art were produced by many cultures worldwide. Petroglyphs are pecked or incised into the rock and pictographs are painted. Both types are found in this region, displaying images of animals, people, geometric designs, and natural features.\n\nPictographs can serve a variety of purposes. They are visual reminders of events, or serve to transmit information about the environment. These images may be communication between human(s) and the supernatural, or between two or more people.\n\nPerhaps the images here were created during a healing ceremony, a vision quest, or a prayer to the creator, to a spirit helper, or to hunted animals. They might be symbols, or a sign marking the way, reminders of a vision and not meaningful to any other individual.\n\nThese pictographs were identified in 2003 by a park ranger and have been professionally documented. This documentation included the photographs seen here, taken with polarized light to capture pigment not visible to the unaided eye. Still unknown are the originator(s), age of the images, and the material used to paint the rock.\n\nCan you find the designs in the pictographs on the rock?",

Face the wayside exhibit labeled \u201cEve of Battle\u201d and you should be facing north to northwest and clearly across the fields in front of you, you should be looking at the Belle Grove Plantation Manor House. Which was being used by General Sheridan, the Union Commander as his army\u2019s headquarters. On the eve of the battle of Cedar Creek, the Army of the Shenandoah was camped on the fields around you. Numbering approximately 32,000 men, this army consisted of three army corps. The 6th Army Corps, the largest corps, was actually camped beyond, west of, and beyond Belle Grove. The army center was held by the 19th Corps, which was located south of Belle Grove, or to your left front, on the high banks above Cedar Creek. That would be to your left front, marked today by the dark woods you see, not directly to your left front, but the second tree line, on the high banks above Cedar Creek. The army's left was held by the 8th Corps, sometimes called the Army of West Virginia, on the east side of the Valley Pike, which is today Route 11 that you are located on. So that is behind you and to your left about a mile and a half to two miles to your left rear. At this point of the campaign, after having won victories at both Third Winchester on September 19, and then Fisher\u2019s Hill on September 22 followed by the Burning in late September and early October General Sheridan believed the campaign was over and that Early\u2019s Army of the Valley posed no threat, Sheridan believed that all he had to decide what part of the Army to leave as a holding force in the Valley to watch General Early\u2019s army. So he left the Valley on October 15 to attend a Council of War in Washington DC. Little did he realize that his army would soon come under attack and that of course would be the Battle of Cedar Creek on October 19th. So at our next stop, stop 2, we will discuss General Early\u2019s attack and how this came about. You can now proceed to stop 2, follow the self-guided directional auto tour signs you have been following so far along the tour route.",

                        "audioTranscript": "We are now at stop #2 of the auto tour. It is called Thoburn\u2019s Redoubt. And the best place to watch this video on the other side of the gate from which you should have parked, so just go around the gate and you should stand right next to the interpretive panel you see here. The position that we are standing at Thoburn\u2019s redoubt was held by Col. Joseph Thoburn\u2019s division of the 8th Corps, about 1,700 men and their far left would have been just off to your east or your left, less than a half mile in that direction. The rest of the Union army would have been positioned upstream along Cedar Creek behind you and to your right so that northwest of here. You are basically facing south and southeast. On a normal day what you would clearly see looming off to the south/southeast in this direction would be the very northern end of the Massanutten Mountain range, sometimes called Three Top Mountain, including the largest peak called Signal Knob. And we will talk about that in just a minute and its importance and its role in the Battle of Cedar Creek. Cedar Creek itself, would start off behind you and to your right rear, northwest of you, flowing downstream, to your right, and eventually off to your right front, and then finally in front of you and the lowest ground in front of you. And then eventually it is going to flow into the North Fork of the Shenandoah which runs along the base of the Massanutten Mountain range. The Cedar Creek would have been held by pickets and skirmishers of the 8th Corps. Remember again, the Army of the Shenandoah, Sheridan\u2019s army numbers about 32,000 men. The 8th Corps along with the 19th Corps off to its right rear, holding the center would have been entrenched, so this is a very strong position on the bluffs above both Cedar Creek and the north fork of the Shenandoah River. 32,000 men, a very strong position. So that means that General Jubal Early, commanding the Confederate Army of the Valley has a very difficult task. He only numbers, even with reinforcements sent by General Lee in Richmond, only 14,000 at the most 15,000 men and here Lee is telling him he must attack the Union army here at Cedar Creek. That means Early is outnumbered 2 \u00bd to 1. To attack this very strong position, is almost asking the impossible. So to try to figure out some kind of plan, a way to somehow attack this nearly impregnable position, what Early will do will send his second in command, General John Gordon and some other officers to the up to the very top of Signal Knob on October 17th. Now Signal Knob being that highest peak of the Massanutten Mountain, Signal Knob got its name during the Civil War. On a clear day, if you could see that mountain peak you would see that it has a modern radio tower on it. Well during the Civil War it got its name from the fact that both sides used it as a signal station to send messages. On that very clear day of October 17th, Gordon got up there with the other officers and they could look right down on the Union army and they could see everything \u2013 they could see every road, every path, they could see every entrenchment, every cannon, every flag. They had to use that to their advantage to scout the Union army and try to come up with a plan. And they also something they had not seen before. A way to try to attack the Union army by surprise from an unexpected direction. So they came down off the mountain, and Gordon told Early his plan. Maybe there was a way to attack the left end of the Union army. Which is something no one thought the Confederates could do. How could you march part of the Confederate army opposite of the Union left? There is no way you can do that and have it be a surprise because the mountain range there, along with the North Fork of the Shenandoah and Cedar Creek, meant there was no way the Confederates could march through that very tight spot without being seen. Gordon thought there was a way and he thought he saw it from the top of Signal Knob where they could get in there using a night march without being seen and that is the plan he present to Early. But this plan is going to be very difficult. It involves dividing the Confederate army into three columns, it is going to involve a night march that means that the men all have to coordinate these three columns and arrive at their attack points on time, which is very difficult to do during the Civil War. How do these three columns communicate? Plus the largest column the one that is going to march along the base of the Massanutten Mountain and make two night crossings of the Shenandoah, have to march along the very narrow path, single file, we are talking thousands of men, not quite 8,000 men along a single file path. Very difficult to do. How are they going to stay on time and not be seen? But Early is willing to try it. So it is really one of the riskiest attack plans ever developed during the Civil War. They start this night march on the night of October 18th from Fisher\u2019s Hill. The old Fisher\u2019s Hill battl",

So after the 8th Corps is crushed and sent fleeing, the 19th Corps now faces the Confederate attack. Fugitives from the 8th Corps would come streaming over the ridge that you see behind you and through the 19th Corps battle line and the fire brought on by the Confederate attack is going to alert the 19th Corps that the attack is underway along with those fugitives. One member of the 19th Corps would later recall the beginning of the Confederate attack that morning when he later wrote this, \u201cI was awakened at the first signs of day by the terrific clap of the thunder and sprang into a sitting position and listened. The thunder was the tremendous volley of the enemy that was pouring into the 8th Corps devoted camp. I listened for the yell of our men but alas it never came, instead the Ay-yi-yi of the Confederate yell and horror of horrors it seemed to me as if our whole left was enveloped and enfolded by this cry.\" So the 19th Corps realizes they face two distinct threats. The main Confederate attack is coming from the left, or behind you, unexpectedly, but they also are going to face another Confederate attack from their front. The rest of the 19th Corps battle line is located on a ridge, a high bluff above Cedar Creek, for about a mile their line stretches on these bluffs behind me. Cedar Creek is below you less than a half a mile, to your south, or to your left. So that threat is coming from their front still the south, but now a new threat is coming from their east, or behind you. So to counter this new threat, troops from the 19th Corps will be shifted over here, and form a new line along the Valley Pike, to face east. It\u2019s called refusing your line. So they face two directions. The main line still faces south, or in this direction. The new line is going to stretch up the road to face east. To face that new threat \u2013 refusing your line. To buy time, to conduct this new maneuver, another part of the 19th Corps, a brigade of just over 1,000 men, will be sent across the Valley Pike in order to basically sacrifice themselves and slow the Confederate onslaught up. Will talk about that action at our next stop, stop 4. After the 8th Corps fugitives come streaming through this new line, they are followed by the Confederate attack, they come springing out of the dense fog, and strikes the 19th Corps line here along the Valley Pike. Despite this new line being formed it wasn\u2019t enough and it is going to start driving the 19th Corps back up their entrenchment line and eventually back towards Belle Grove. They conduct a fighting withdrawal and eventually, as we will discuss at a future stop, back towards Belle Gove itself. From here we will move to our next stop, stop 4. As you leave this area and turn left on the Valley Pike or Route 11 today, be extremely careful as traffic comes along very quickly along the Valley Pike or Route 11, especially from your left.",

Belle Grove is actually owned by the National Trust for Historic Preservation. It is a 1790\u2019s Plantation Manor House and it is managed by another partner, Belle Grove, Incorporated. Belle Grove is well worth a visit if you have time, it is a beautifully restored Plantation Manor House. It was built by Isaac Hite, Jr. who married Nelly Madison, who would be the sister of future President James Madison. They\u2019ve restored it and furnished it with period pieces and actually some original belongings of the Hite family. So if you have time, start your visit behind you at the Welcome Center. They have guided house tours, and the grounds tours are free. So please spend your time, if you have time to do so, and visit the manor house and the grounds itself.\n\nAs I said, before and during the Battle of Cedar Creek, this was General Sheridan\u2019s Headquarters, although General Sheridan as we have talked about was not here during the battle. Having gone to Washington D.C. returning to the Valley on the 18th of October, but having spent the night in Winchester 15 miles to the north which is behind you. Behind me or to your south, you will actually see the Massanutten Mountain range. Signal Knob itself is actually hidden behind the trees directly behind me. As we discussed at stop #3, the 19th Army Corps, holding the center of the Union line had come under attack and had been driven out of its entrenchments, and now is fighting across the ground in front of Belle Grove or south of us. Belle Grove being the army\u2019s headquarters had been surrounded by supplies, tents, and wagons, again this is the nerve center of the Union army. And although the 19th Corps was fighting hard to try to hold back the Confederate onslaught, it was simply a matter of time before the Confederates reached this area. While the 19th Corps is retreating in this direction they are scrambling as you can imagine, to evacuate Belle Grove. What again is assisting the Confederate attack has they drive the 19th Corps in this direction is that dense fog, we keep mentioning because it hides the Confederate troops from view until they are right on top of the Union line. One Union soldier in the 19th Corps remembered this during the fighting as they fought back in this direction towards Belle Grove. He later recalled, \u201cThe fog was so dense that we could not see the enemy in front of us. But the rapid and incessant discharge of small arms and canon, the bursting of shells and whizzing of bullets, mingling into the sound like that of a moaning wind told us unmistakably of its presence.\u201d Well eventually it was just a matter of time before Belle Grove fell and it did at 7:00 am, about two hours after the Confederate assault began, the 19th Corps is driven out of this area. Belle Grove falls, although most of the supplies, wagons, and tents have been evacuated, and the Confederates pass through this area. That leaves only the 6th Corps remaining. The 6th Corps occupying the ground behind you in your right rear, which is to our northwest. They are going to form along Meadow Brook. As you drive to your next stop, stop #6 the Cemetery Hill, you are going to drive along Meadow Brook Road. The Confederates are going to be coming from your right to left and the Union line the 6th Corps is going to be on the high ground on either side of that road. Eventually the 6th Corps will also be driven out of their camps and off that high ground, where they make the final, their only real stand at Cemetery Hill which is our next stop.",

                        "audioTranscript": "You are now at stop #6 on the auto tour. This is called Mt. Carmel Cemetery which at the time of the battle was known as Middletown Cemetery. Cemetery behind me obviously was much smaller at the time of the battle, but it is still an active cemetery today, and that is why it is obviously why it is much larger. The town of Middletown itself is actually right behind these trees, to your left, or to your east, less than a half a mile away. More obvious is the Signal Knob and Massanutten Mountain which you clearly see in the distance behind me or to your south, southeast. The battlefield here is changed somewhat since 1864, and that is the growth of the non-historic vegetation or woods that you see both off to your left or to your east. Those don\u2019t belong. And also to our south, directly to our south at the end of the cemetery, those don\u2019t belong either, and they have grown up since the time of the battle. Along with the trees to our right or to the west, they would have been woods but much farther back or farther to the west. That\u2019s why the Park Service, when we put up our wayside exhibits that belong at each stop, like this one here, that\u2019s why we commissioned this original piece of artwork to try to depict what the actual view shed would have looked like in 1864. So if you take a careful look at this wayside, this painting depicts the historic view shed and what the soldiers would have seen in 1864. So as we have previously talked about at stops 3 & 4, the Confederate attack had rolled up the Union line crushing the 8th Corps and then the 19th Corps and driving them out of their camps and north and capturing Belle Grove the Union army\u2019s headquarters. That left only the 6th Corps, as the only remaining corps on the battlefield to offer any resistance to the Confederate attack. And although they fought along Meadow Brook, the stream, we discussed and then drove along to get to this stop. The 6th Corps alone could not stop the Confederate attack and eventually as the 6th Corps retreated it left this as the only defensible position on which to make a stand. And one division of the 6th Corps, about 2,400 men of a division led by George Washington Getty, realized this was the place, the only place they could take a stand. And with this historic view shed, kind of recreated in this painting, and you can see a sliver of it kind of here through the opening in the trees. This really became the place to try to stop the Confederate attack. So George Washington Getty\u2019s division, formed a battle line here, on the morning of the battle around 8:00 to try to stop or at least slow the Confederate attack down. So Getty formed his men along the south face of the hill, directly in front of you, and then also turned it to the left along the east base of the hill, or over here to your left. So they faced two directions. And for about an hour and a half, they literally stopped the Confederate attack. They had some support on their right too along the south face of the hill along the same route we just drove up a minute ago. They stopped three separate Confederate attacks against the hill. The first two were kind of, ill-conceived or the first two Confederate attacks were disorganized because by this point, as you can imagine, the Confederates were disorganized having marched all night, and then fought four hours to get here, and thought they could roll over the Union line, and this is really the first time they met any resistance. Frustrated, General Early, the Confederate commander, lined up his 30 pieces of artillery along the Valley Pike which you can barely see out there in the distance. About a mile away that is the dark trees it\u2019s where modern factories are today. And he bombarded this spot for half hour to try to soften up the Union defenders. During this bombardment, one of Getty\u2019s brigade commanders, General Bidwell, you can see here in the painting, he actually got mortally wounded and hit by an artillery shell, mortally wounded and would die from his wounds. And after a half an hour they launched a third attack against the Union line. This third attack actually reached the slopes of the hill and got amongst the Union batteries of artillery involving hand to hand fighting. Literally hand spikes and rammers. Didn\u2019t take the battery but was very intense fighting. But it was that third attack that finally drove the Union line off the hill because it outflanked Getty\u2019s division on the right or over here to your west. If he had stayed Getty realized he would be surrounded and captured. So he finally around 9:30 having stood here for an hour and a half, ordered his men to retreat. And that was really was the last Union resistance that morning to the Confederate assault. At that point the entire Union army was retreating north of Middletown, behind you, to your north where they tried to rally their lines. The Confederates followed, forming their final battle line to the north which we will talk about at our next stop. The Confe",

And this marks the final Confederate line, or at least part of the final Confederate line on the morning of the battle. Around 10:30 after the Confederates pushed out to this area. Around that same time as the Confederate advance finally halted, and the Confederates were beginning to reorganize their lines, discovering as we discussed at stop #6, that up to a third of the men were back looting the Union camps, another controversy occurred in the Confederate army. And that would go down as the Fatal Halt. General Gordon, second in command of the Confederate army, was arguing with Jubal Early, the top commander, that they should be pushing forward, moving north to your right because that is where the Union army is rallying, about a mile to our north. And they should push the Union army off the battlefield. Gordon is arguing that the battle is not over, the Union army is not defeated, and that they should push on. Early, however, is saying we have done enough for one day, the Confederates are too disorganized, remember all those Confederates are looting and as far as he was concerned the Union army was done. At this point, the Confederacy captured over 1,000 Union prisoners and 24 cannon. Early figured the best the Union army could do, since they were so badly defeated was retreat to Winchester their main base of operations about 15 miles to the north. As far as Early was concerned this battle was over. So he would gather in his captured spoils, wait till nightfall. He had won the great victory that Lee had hoped for in the Valley and would retreat under the cover of darkness. This controversy would go down again as the Fatal Halt. While they were arguing they suddenly hear cheering off in the distance off in along the Union lines. And this would involve one of the most famous incidents in the entire battle.

Looking south, downstream along Meadow Brook. This is the same Meadow Brook that runs straight down through the middle of the battlefield before flowing into Cedar Creek. And we have seen it at different points on the battlefield. It was in this area where General Sheridan would arrive back from Winchester and would greet his retreating and rallying army. As we have talked about previously, Sheridan was not here when the battle began. He had spent the previous night in Winchester, having no idea that his army would come under attack on the morning of the 19th of October. He gets up that morning having no idea that his army has been attacked and defeated. Starts riding back to his army, hearing the distance thunder of artillery, thinking maybe it is a skirmish, or a reconnaissance by his forces. Only to be told that his army is under attack, is retreating, as he rides south along the Valley Pike. The Valley Pike would be off to your east, or to your left. You are looking south downstream along Meadow Brook. He soon is greeted by retreating Union soldiers from the battlefield, having come over 10 miles, spreading rumors of defeat and disaster. They start to cheer Sheridan, realizing he is coming back to the battlefield. In typical Sheridan fashion, he tells them stop cheering me, if you love your country follow me back to the battlefield. And many do, they turn and follow him. This begins what would become as Sheridan start to pick up his pace and ride back to the battlefield - Sheridan\u2019s Ride. He will ride over 10 miles up the Valley Pike, which is now Route 11 today, US Route 11. Rallying more and more soldiers along the way, and finally where Kline\u2019s Mill Road greets or intersects with Route 11 today, the Valley Pike back then, he will greet his rallying Union army north of Middletown. He later left a vivid account of the first sight that greeted him upon seeing his shattered army, north of Middletown that morning. He wrote, \u201cThere burst upon our view an appalling spectacle of panic. I stared down upon our stricken army, hundreds of slightly wounded men, throngs of others not hurt but utterly demoralized and baggage wagons by the score all pressing to the rear in hopeless confusion. Telling only too plainly that a disaster had occurred at the front.\u201d His officers greeted him. They were now rallying his army south of Kline\u2019s Mill road in the fields you have been passing by. One of his officers told him I think we are in good enough shape to retreat back to Winchester, his main base of operations. Of course Sheridan did not want to hear anything of retreating. Once his forces were in good enough shape he was going to immediately counterattack. This battle could not go down as a Union defeat here in the Shenandoah Valley he realized so close to the upcoming Presidential election in early November. One of his staff officers suggested, \u201cShow yourself to your men General, let them know you are back on the battlefield.\u201d And that is exactly what Sheridan would do. He would start riding along his rallying lines and the effect was instantaneous, his demoralized men instantly rallied to his presence. One of his men later talked about this, writing, \u201cThe men sprang to their feet and cheered only as men under such circumstances can. Hope and confidence returned and abound. No longer did we merely hope that the worst was over. That we could hold our ground till night, or worse to make an orderly retreat to Winchester. Now all burned to avenge and attack the enemy, to drive him back, retrieve our honor, and sleep in our old campground that night. And every man knew that Sheridan would do it.\u201d The attack wouldn\u2019t start immediately however, it would take several hours to straighten his lines and make final adjustments, but eventually the Union counterattack would begin that afternoon at 4:00 and that attack we will discuss at the final stop on our tour, stop 9.",

You should be at the interpretive marker labeled-The Union Counterattack. Face the marker and you will be looking to your west, and in the distance you will see the Alleghany Mountains. Also, looking in that direction, to your left front, amongst the trees, you will see the metal roof of the historic Miller House, which we talked about and saw at stop #7. Remember that Miller House is along the final Confederate line that afternoon, just north of Middletown and along the historic Miller Lane, today called Cougill Road. That marks the left end of the Confederate line, which was lined with heavy stone walls and made an excellent defensive position. Also, remember the Confederate line ran at least a half a mile, if not slightly longer beyond the Miller House. The right end of the Confederate line actually continued to stretch on the other side of the Valley Pike, Route 11 today, behind you, but also farther to your south, closer to Middletown which is off to your left. Also, looking to your left rear, you will see in the distance the top of Massanutten Mountain including Signal Knob. The Confederate right again stretched to the north of Middletown, on the other side of the Valley Pike and beyond where modern day interstate 81 is today. Despite the fact that many Confederates were still looting the Union camps, remember General Early the Confederate commander believes that he can wait out the Union army which is to your right a mile to your north, until nightfall and then retreat under cover of darkness. As we know, General Sheridan has returned to the battlefield, he has rallied his army, and now will begin his counterattack around 4:00 pm that afternoon. That counterattack starts and that Union lines stretching 2 miles in length. His line also stretching beyond interstate 81 where it is today and across the Valley Pike will sweep across the open ground in front of you, from your right to left, and came rolling across this ground which was much more open back then, and towards the final Confederate line. Despite being outnumbered the Confederates stood their ground and gave the Union attack a murderous fire. One Union soldier in the attack later recounted this. He said, \u201cWe got into the open fields, the rebels pouring into our faces a deadly fire from behind a stone wall. We gain a hill in the enemy front and here we halt and pour in our own fire. Of all the fires I was ever under during the war I think it was by far the hottest. The air boils and seized with mini\u00e9 balls and screeching shells and solid shot and deadly canister. All tear and plunge through our ranks. Our boys fall thick and fast.\u201d At first the Union counterattack was basically halted in its tracks. And some of the heaviest and deadliest fighting of the entire battle took place in the fields right out in front of you. What finally brought the Confederate line, broke it I should say, and drove it back was the fact that the Union right was much longer than the Confederate left and it began to overlap it at the far end of Miller Lane and began to outflank it and drive it in. And what turned the Confederate retreat, because the Confederate left began to crumble into a rout, was Union cavalry. There was an immense Union cavalry force way beyond the Confederate right and beyond the Confederate left as it was, and began to sweep in across the open fields. Some of that Union cavalry led by none other than George Armstrong Custer, who led a division of Union cavalry, came sweeping in beyond the Confederate left and turned that retreat into a panic. The Confederate left basically crumbled and the whole Confederate line, from its left to right or west to east towards you crumbled. Despite the efforts of Confederate officers, the Confederate line just began to roll up and collapse and the whole Confederate battle line just retreated, routed back towards Middletown. And the same ground they fought so hard to gain that morning was basically now lost. Through Middletown, passed Belle Grove, over Cedar Creek, through the streets of Strasburg, there was a traffic jam. Much of the spoils of war they captured that morning were now lost including all 24 guns they had captured, they lost all of those and 24 of their own. So the Union counterattack captured 48 guns during the retreat. Also, they captured, the Union army captured 1,200, one thousand two hundred prisoners. What was left of Early\u2019s army tried to rally itself at Fisher\u2019s Hill where they started the night before. The Battle of Cedar Creek would end as a tremendous Union victory. Total casualties that day for the Union army 5,700 killed, wounded, missing, including almost 600 dead. The Confederate army although not nearly as high in number were about 2,900, almost 3,000 but considering how much smaller the Confederate army was a very high percentage. This basically finished off Early\u2019s army. And what was left",

The round-trip distance from Old Faithful Visitor Center is 5.2 miles (8.3 km).  \n\nPlease note: Thermal activity occurs throughout this area. Stay on the boardwalk at all times. \n\nBecause of the dynamic nature of the features along this tour, you may complete the tour in as little as a half-hour or be out for an hour or more. Before heading out, a few safety notes: \n\nIt can be windy, so cinch down your hats and secure personal items. \n\nStay on the boardwalks and established trails at all times. Superheated water is just below a thin crust throughout the basin. Besides the high chance of breaking through the crust and causing bodily injury or death, leaving the trail can damage hydrothermal features\u2014ruining the experience for everyone. \n\nBoardwalks can be slippery when wet or covered in snow. \n\nWatch for wildlife and maintain the minimum safe distance of 25 yards (2 bus-lengths) from any wildlife\u2014and 100 yards (8 bus-lengths) from bears or wolves. \n\nReady?  Let\u2019s head across the footbridge to a series of hot-spring pools, two of which are named for\u2014you guessed it\u2014jewels!",

Typically, when one spring is active, the other is dormant, a result of the subterranean plumbing they share. For a long time, they were relatively quiet pools. After the Borah Peak earthquake in 1983, East Mustard became active and West Mustard fell silent. East Mustard is currently an active geyser with frequent eruptions reaching up to 6 feet (2 m) high. \n\nWe hope you enjoyed Biscuit Basin\u2019s colorful springs and geysers and found many reasons to preserve and protect the resources of this planet\u2014from the thermal features of Yellowstone to the nature near your home.",

This tour explores the inspiring history of the free African American community of Beacon Hill in the 19th century, a community that led the city and the nation in the fight against slavery and racial injustice.  \nWe will be stopping at historic homes, churches, schools, and other important sites as we discuss the lives and legacies of these leaders and activists.  \nTogether with those that found common cause with them, this community helped turn Boston into a crucial center of the Abolition Movement, the Underground Railroad, and the early struggle for civil rights and equality.  \nFacing powerful opposition both within the city and throughout the country, this community persevered, and in doing so, helped further Boston\u2019s reputation as a \"Cradle of Liberty\" in the ongoing American Revolution.  \nOur first stop is The Robert Gould Shaw and Massachusetts 54th Regiment Memorial, which commemorates one of the first African American regiments of the Civil War. Following his Emancipation Proclamation in 1863, President Lincoln called for the raising of Black regiments.  Massachusetts Governor John Andrew soon created the Massachusetts 54th Volunteer Infantry and chose Robert Gould Shaw, the son of prominent abolitionists, to serve as its colonel.  \nNotable abolitionists including Frederick Douglass and local leaders such as Lewis Hayden recruited men for the 54th Regiment. Men enlisted from every region of the country, and from as far away as Canada and the Caribbean.\nThrough their heroic, yet tragic, assault on Fort Wagner, South Carolina on July 18, 1863, in which Shaw and many of his men died, the 54th helped erode Northern public opposition to the use of Black soldiers and inspired the enlistment of more than 180,000 Black men into the United States forces. \nSergeant William H. Carney, severely injured in the battle, saved the regiment\u2019s flag. For this act of bravery, he became the first African American recipient of the Medal of Honor. \nTo commemorate this brave Black regiment, Bostonians chose Augustus St. Gaudens to create this high relief bronze monument, which sits prominently on Beacon Street across from the Massachusetts State House.  \nSaint-Gaudens took nearly fourteen years to complete his masterpiece. \nUnveiled on May 31st, 1897, this monument depicts the 54th as they marched down Beacon Street off for war in 1863.\nIt stands as a powerful testament to the cost of freedom and to the true meaning of the Civil War.",

The Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts had declared slavery \u201cinconsistent\u201d with our State Constitution a few years earlier in 1783.  While Black families had begun settling this north slope of Beacon Hill about a generation before, in the mid-1760s, Middleton\u2019s arrival to this emerging neighborhood signaled a new beginning as he and others in that Revolutionary generation staked their claim in Boston and laid the foundation for the larger abolition and equal rights movements to come.  \nGeorge Middleton and Louis Glapion began constructing this two-family residence at 5 Pinckney Street in 1786. Finished a year later, this building is believed to be the oldest standing home on Beacon Hill. \nLouis Glapion worked as a hairdresser and may have been from the French West Indies. Glapion lived and ran his business here until his death in 1813. His wife, Lucy, continued to live here until 1832.\nWe know a little bit more about George Middleton.  During the Revolution, he led a Black militia company called the Bucks of America. While little evidence of this group has survived, they likely guarded the property of Boston merchants during the Revolution and may have also been known as the \"Protectors.\" Near the close of the Revolution, Governor John Hancock presented Middleton and the Bucks of America with a company flag. According to the historian William Cooper Nell, this banner, now preserved in the collections of the Massachusetts Historical Society, served \u201cas a tribute to their courage and devotion through the struggle.\u201d\nA horse breaker and livery man by profession, Middleton also served in several Black community organizations. He became the third Grand Master of the African Lodge, later known as the Prince Hall Masons. In 1796, Middleton and others organized the African Society, a charitable organization dedicated to community service, uplift, and education. He became a licensed teacher in that organization as well.\nMiddleton married Elsey Marsh in 1781 at Trinity Church and died in 1815, apparently not survived by his wife or children.\nAs a leader concerned with education, the abolition of slavery, and the needs of his community, George Middleton helped build some of the early institutions and organizations in the long history of Black activism on Beacon Hill.",

They lived in this house by 1850, operated as a boardinghouse, and turned it into one of the most documented safe houses in the area. A long-time colleague of the Hayden, Henry Bowditch recalled that their house served as \u201cthe temple of refuge for any hunted refugee from Southern slavery.\u201d  \nFollowing the passage of the 1850 Fugitive Slave Law, Bostonians created their third and final Vigilance Committee, an organization dedicated to fugitive assistance. As one of the most active members of this committee, Lewis sheltered and assisted scores of freedom seekers. The Haydens provided shelter, clothing, carriages, and fare to get people out of the city and further North to freedom. \nIn 1850, the Haydens sheltered the famous couple William and Ellen Craft who had escaped from slavery in Georgia through an elaborate disguise and story. The light-skinned Ellen dressed in men\u2019s clothing and \u201cpassed\u201d as a white male slaveholder traveling North by train and ship with her trusted \u201cslave\u201d William. In October 1850, slave catchers came looking for the couple in Boston\u2019s first test of the new Fugitive Slave Law.  According to William Craft, \u201cLewis Hayden and I had a keg of gunpowder under his house ...with a fuse attached ready to light it should any attempt be made to capture us.\u201d Given all of the abolitionist hostility and threats to their safety, the slave catchers abandoned their pursuit of the Crafts.  A journalist later wrote that the slave catcher called off  his pursuit because he \u201cknew that the road to hell lay over Lewis Hayden\u2019s threshold; and the cost to him would be rather more than the Slave Power would be ready to make up to him.\u201d \nIn addition to protecting the Crafts, Lewis also played a crucial role in other high-profile Fugitive Slave Law cases in the city.  On February 15, 1851, slave catchers arrested Shadrach Minkins who had escaped from Virginia months earlier. Within three hours of the arrest, Hayden led a group of Black men in a daring courthouse rescue, freed Minkins from his captors, and successfully got him out of the city and further on the Underground Railroad network to Canada. In 1854, Hayden and others attempted to rescue Anthony Burns from federal custody at the same courthouse. Unfortunately, they failed, and authorities soon returned Burns to the South under heavy martial guard.  \nIn addition to his Underground Railroad work, Lewis played other prominent roles in his community. He served as Grand Master of the Prince Hall Masons, presided over numerous community meetings and participated in the Equal Schools movement. In the late 1850s, he began serving as Messenger to the Secretary of State, a politically appointed position, likely making him one of the first Black state employees.\nDuring the Civil War, he recruited Black soldiers for the Massachusetts civil war regiments. Following the War, Hayden served as one of the first Black members of the state legislature and lent his support in the fight for women\u2019s suffrage.\nHarriet outlived her husband by four years.  When she passed away in 1893, she left her estate, valued at $5000, to Harvard University to establish the Lewis and Harriet Hayden Scholarship for Black students wishing to attend the Medical School.",

This is where you joined with William Cooper Nell as he advocated for Equal School Rights. This is where Lewis Hayden, John Smith, John Coburn, and others protested the Fugitive Slave Law and planned how to assist freedom seekers that came to Boston on the Underground Railroad. This is where you came in the early 1830s to hear Maria Stewart call for the end of slavery and for equal rights for women. This is where the Massachusetts General Colored Association came together to fight for the end of slavery and discrimination throughout the country. It is where William Lloyd Garrison formed the New England Antislavery Society, whose principles he said would quote \u201cshake the nation by their mighty power.\u201d It also served as a recruitment center for the 54th Regiment.\nIn his recruitment speech for the 54th, Frederick Douglass said \"... We can get at the throat of treason and slavery through the State of Massachusetts. She was first in the War of Independence; first to break the chains of her slaves; first to make the black man equal before the law; first to admit colored children to her common schools, and she was first to answer with her blood the alarm cry of the nation, when its capital was menaced by rebels. You know her patriotic governor, and you know Charles Summer. I need not add more. Massachusetts now welcomes you to arms as soldiers.\"\nThis is such a ringing endorsement of the central role played by Boston in the fight against slavery and racial injustice...so much of which emanated from this neighborhood, from this community, and from within the walls of the African Meeting House.\nThe Meeting House continued to serve as a Black church and community center until the end of the 1800s. It became a synagogue in 1904. In 1972, the Meeting House was purchased by the Museum of African American History, who continues to own and operate it today.  \nIn 1980, Boston African American National Historic Site was created as a partner with the Museum to keep these important sites preserved and protected, and to keep these crucial stories of our ongoing American Revolution alive.  \nThank you for joining us for this virtual tour of the Black Heritage Trail.",

This relatively small thermal group on the banks of Iron Spring Creek features some of the most splendid hot springs in Yellowstone. \n\nPlease note: Thermal activity occurs throughout this area. Stay on the boardwalk at all times.\n\nBecause of the dynamic nature of the features along this tour, you may complete the tour in as little as a half-hour, or be out for an hour or more. Before heading out, a few safety notes:\n\nIt can be windy, so cinch down your hats and secure personal items.\n\nStay on the boardwalks and established trails at all times. Superheated water is just below a thin crust throughout the basin. Besides the high chance of breaking through the crust and causing bodily injury or death, leaving the trail can damage hydrothermal features\u2014ruining the experience for everyone.\n\nBoardwalks can be slippery when wet or covered in snow.\n\nWatch for wildlife and maintain the minimum safe distance of 25 yards (2 bus-lengths) from any wildlife\u2014and 100 yards (8 bus-lengths) from bears or wolves.\n\nReady? Head on to the next stop: Opalescent Pool. As you walk along Iron Spring Creek (commonly referred to as Iron Creek), notice the orange bacterial mats in the runoff channels. Members of the 1871 Hayden Survey named the creek for what they thought were deposits of iron oxide.",

The system also requires water, such as ground water from the mountains, and snow and rain that slowly percolate through layers of permeable rock riddled with cracks.\n\nOpalescent Pool is a good example of a hydrothermal feature altered by a natural flux in the interplay of heat and water over time. This pool may have originated as an active, boiling spring, but these days it has no hot-water source of its own. Instead, it is filled with runoff flowing from nearby Spouter Geyser, and the cooler water creates the right conditions for the milky, opal-like color caused by fine particles of silica suspended in the water.",

A constriction in the underground plumbing causes pressure to build up until it is released in an eruption. Cliff Geyser\u2019s eruption cycle begins with an empty crater and minor eruptions lasting only seconds. The crater slowly fills and, at a critical point, the confined bubbles lift the water above the surface vent, causing the geyser to splash or overflow in bursts as high as 40 feet (12 m) for 5 to 15 minutes. The eruption stops when the water reservoir is depleted or when the system cools.\n\nAs you view Cliff Geyser, notice the water level in its crater: Is it filling with water, or is it empty and quiet? What you observe above the surface can tell you what\u2019s happening below. Intervals between eruptions can range from a matter of hours to several weeks or even to many months.",

Near the lighthouse are a visitor center, a pair of short trails, and a swim beach that has lifeguards on duty during the summer. Visiting all of the sites on this tour will take about an hour and covers about 1-1/2 miles on the ground and a 1-mile drive between the Bodie Island Lighthouse grounds and Coquina Beach Day Use Area.\n\nThe Bodie Island Visitor Center is a great place to start any visit to this part of the seashore. National Park Service rangers are stationed here to answer any questions you have. You can also purchase your tickets to climb the lighthouse and purchase off-road vehicle permits. You can pick up a free beach fire permit and you can explore the selection of items for sale in the gift store. Restroom facilities are located outside at the start of the Bodie Island Nature Trail.\n\nThis was once the living quarters of the lighthouse keepers. Take a moment and ponder the life of a lighthouse keeper, and what it might have been like to live in a remote area before bridges connected the islands and tourism brought thousands of visitors to the area. What do you think some of the challenges would have been living in an isolated place? Explore this site within the app to discover more.\n\nIf you are visiting between the third Friday in April and Columbus Day, and you want to climb the lighthouse, be sure to purchase tickets here. When you are ready, exit the visitor center to head on to the next stop.",

Imagine being aboard a ship in the ocean during a calm day, during a stormy day, or during a stormy night. If you were on that ship, how important would that lighthouse be to you?\n\nNow, take a moment to feel the sand and look at the grains. Most of the sand is made up of quartz from the Appalachian Mountains, although that\u2019s not all that is in the sand. The coarser, orange grains are tiny bits of seashells that came from the ocean floor, and over time have been ground up. If you happen to have picked up sand with the fine, black particles, then you\u2019ve picked up magnetite (and some semi-precious minerals) that also made there way here from the Appalachian Mountains!\n\nThanks for going on this tour of Bodie Island Lighthouse Area.

                        "audioTranscript": "The air buzzed with anticipation on the sunny Saturday morning of June 17, 1843 as crowds made their way to Charlestown. Reporters estimated over 100,000 people packed the grassy hill of what is now Monument Square for the dedication of the newly completed Bunker Hill Monument. They gathered to remember the fallen men and to honor the surviving patriots who fought on this ground 68 years earlier in a battle that became symbolic of the birth of the United States.  \n\nAmong these witnesses were honored guests: President John Tyler, former senator and current Secretary of State Daniel Webster, and twelve of the surviving patriots of the Battle of Bunker Hill. Over a hundred other veterans of the Revolutionary War joined them.  \n\nDaniel Webster stepped forward to give the oration of the dedication ceremony, declaring: \n\n\"A duty has been performed. A work of gratitude and patriotism is completed. This structure, having its foundations in soil which drank deep of early revolutionary blood, has at length reached its destined height, and now lifts its summit to the skies\u2026We have assembled to celebrate the accomplishment of this undertaking, and to indulge, afresh, in the recollection of the great event which it is designed to commemorate.\"\n\nFrom the beginning, Webster acknowledged that the monument represented not only the battle and the men who fought on this hallowed ground, but also something more: \n\n\"It has a purpose; and that purpose gives it character. That purpose enrobes it with dignity and moral grandeur\u2026it looks, it speaks, it acts, to the full comprehension of every American mind, and the awakening of glowing enthusiasm in every American heart. Its silent, but awful \tutterance; its deep pathos, as it brings to our contemplation the 17th of June, 1775, and the consequences which have result to us, to our country, and to the world, from the events of that \tday, and which we know must continue to rain influence on the destinies of mankind to the end of time\u2026\"\n\nThe Battle of Bunker Hill has served as a cornerstone of the American Revolution. The people who dedicated the Bunker Hill Monument believed it stood as a physical symbol of the values and principles for which the men of Bunker Hill fought: liberty, patriotism, and sacrifice.  \n\nBoth during the time of the battle and today, the definitions of these values remain deeply personal and fluid. Did the soldiers of Bunker Hill fight for the same understanding of liberty and patriotism? How have later generations built upon and redefined the legacy and meaning of the values that the Monument embodies?   \n\nFollow in the footsteps of three men who fought in the Battle of Bunker Hill and consider the lasting memory and meaning of the battle and its monument.",

British soldiers occupied Boston across the river, war ships blockaded the harbor, and the entire countryside stood on edge about what was to come. \n\nPeter Brown, a 22-year-old white male, lived and worked in Westford, Massachusetts, about 35 miles northwest of Boston. He was a member of that town\u2019s local militia, which meant training and exercising with his neighbors in military drill.  As tensions mounted in Boston, these military drills took on an increasingly serious tone.  As he explained to his mother: \n\n\"Before these long threat'ned difficulties began among us, I had plan'd [to go out to] Connecticut where I expected to work the Summer; but the Allwise in his providence hath very differently plann'd my summer work.\" \n\nBrown answered the alarm called in the immediate aftermath of fighting at Lexington and Concord. He first rode as a post, carrying messages, and then caught up with the militia as a foot soldier. Encamped in Cambridge, Brown enlisted in Col. Prescott\u2019s regiment in the Army of New England in April 1775. As he put it: \n\n\"all business then being stagnated, and a great deal wholly broke up, I did not know what I could do better than to enlist. Therefore being hearty in the cause, I did it directly.\"\n\nLess than two months later, his unit prepared for a march late into the evening of June 16, 1775: \n\n\"We march'd down, on to Charlesto[w]n Hill against [Copp\u2019s] hill in Boston, where we entrench'd & made a Fort... we work'd there undiscovered till about five in the Morning. When we saw our danger, being against Ships of the Line, and all Boston fortified against us The danger we were in made us think there was treachery and that we were brought there to be all slain \"\n\nAfter hours of digging in the dark, the rising sun exposed their position, allowing British cannon to fire on Brown and his comrades in the redoubt. Brown, determined to stay, did his best to survive as others fled for their lives: \n\n\"We began to be almost beat out, being fatigued by our Labour, having no sleep the night before, very little to eat, no drink but rum, but what we hazzarded our lives to get, we grew faint, Thirsty, hungry and weary. --The enemy fir'd very warm from Boston, and from on board their Ships\n\nOur Officers sent time after time for Cannon from Cambridge in the Morning & could get but four, the Captn of which fir'd a few times then swung his Hat three times round to the enemy and ceas'd [to] fire\"\n\nMen like Brown hoped for further reinforcement, as British guns roared in preparation for an eventual assault.",

John Nixon\u2019s unit was one of the first regiments to respond, with Peter Salem, a formerly enslaved man, in its ranks.   \n\nSalem grew up enslaved on a farm in Framingham, Massachusetts with his mother. In early 1775, his enslaver sold him to Major Lawson Buckminster. Shortly after, the 25-year-old Peter Salem, alongside his neighbors, joined his town's unit to meet the British forces on the road from Concord back to Boston on April 19.  \n\nAnswering the alarm on Battle Road, it remains unclear: Did Peter Salem now fight as a free man? Did Major Buckminster promise freedom for service, or would Salem's pay as a soldier purchase his freedom? Did his community still see him as property, or as an equal? Salem did not return home after Lexington and Concord but stayed with his unit, posted under Col. John Nixon's regiment.  Somewhere between enslavement and freedom, Peter Salem now served as a soldier. \n\nOn this June day, Salem rushed to help defend the redoubt on Breed\u2019s Hill. The unit had marched through Charlestown Neck \u2013 a thin strip of land connecting Charlestown to the mainland. British cannon raked across this choke point, mutilating a handful of unlucky men. Nixon\u2019s unit ascended up the hill and joined the redoubt, providing badly needed reinforcements, as men like Brown had been there all night and now all day without rest. Even still, men like Salem had just small numbers of cartridges with which to load their muskets, and few had bayonets if the British forces breached the wall. The fight would still be a desperate one. \n\nSalem also served with other African American militia men, such as Titus Coburn, Salem Poor, and Seymour Burr. In fact, over one hundred patriots of color, both indigenous men and men of African descent, fought on this battlefield. While confusion and disorder plagued the response to the British attack, Col. Nixon, a seasoned veteran, sent his men to the redoubt and it is here where Salem and his fellow comrades entered the battle.  \n\nWhen British forces began their attacks, they lumbered closer into the range of Peter Salem and Peter Brown\u2019s muskets. General Henry Dearborn remembers this confrontation from the Patriots\u2019 perspective: \n\n\"Our men were intent on cutting down every officer whom they could distinguish in the British line. When any of them discovered one he would instantly exclaim \u201cthere,\u201d \u201csee that officer,\u201d \u201clet us have a shot at him,\u201d when two or three would fire at the same moment; and as our soldiers were excellent marksmen and rested their muskets over the fence, they were sure of their object. \"",

Under the command of Major Pitcairn, Marines were part of the expeditionary force that marched to Lexington and Concord.  \n\nOn June 17, Waller was ordered to march with his men to the North Battery in Boston before embarking to Charlestown. Landing near the base of the redoubt, Waller recognized that the redoubt was \"render'd more formidable, by the difficult Access to it.\" Despite this difficulty, Waller led his men into battle against the New England militia.  \n\n\"We were soon order'd to advance and attack the natural defences of the Redoubt and to storm that also at all Events. we gain'd Ground on the Enemy but slowly, as the Rails Hedges & stone walls, broke at every time we got over them and several Men were shot, in the Act of climbing them, we at length overcame these difficulties with very little loss till we came to the Talus of the Redoubt at the bottom of which was a Road with Hedges & Trees on each side...on the part we were Jumbled together. \u2026 in this situation we received a Check...from the very heavy and severe Fire from the Enemy in the Redoubt, and in this Spot we lost a number of Men.\"\n\nThe British forces struggled to gain ground and suffered numerous casualties, but Waller continued to push his men uphill. Waller worked to keep this thrust organized as they approached the redoubt from the southeast. Even though today the neighborhood is almost completely developed, the hill still increases in incline as one makes the walk from the waterfront towards the monument. With each step, the slope grew steeper, and the fire from the redoubt grew more effective with deadly consequences: \n\n\"We were now in confusion, after being broke several times in getting over the rails, etc. I did all I could to form the two companies on our right, which at last I effected, losing many of them while it was performing\u2026 had we stopped there much longer, the enemy would have picked us all off.\"",

John Waller, however, all survived the battle and their subsequent lives took them separate ways. Nevertheless, their experiences on the battlefield remained with them.  \nA week after the battle, Peter Brown wrote to his mother reflecting on this decisive day. Although recognizing the New England defeat, Brown expressed his admiration for the heroics he witnessed at the battle: \n\"But God in Mercy to us fought our battle, and tho\u2019 we were but few in number, and suffer\u2019d to be defeated by our enemy, yet we were presrev[ed] in a most wonderful manner, far beyond our expectation and to our admiration... \"\nBrown firmly believed in the cause the men fought for during this battle, and he pledged to continue this fight:  \n\"Nor do I conclude that the danger is yet over, unless God in his Mercy either remove our enemy, or heal the breach --- but if we should be\u202fcall'd\u202fagain to action I hope to have courage and strength to act my part\u202fvaliently\u202fin\u202fdefence\u202fof our Liberties & Country.\" \nPeter Brown completed the duration of his eight-month service in the militia and likely returned home. The rest of his life remains in obscurity, but his words of the Battle of Bunker Hill have lived on.  \nIn the aftermath of the battle, Waller remained encamped on the battlefield, ready for a follow-up attack. Aware that word was spreading about the conflict at Breed\u2019s Hill, Lieutenant John Waller wrote to his brother:  \n\"I am sat down to tell you I have escaped unhurt, where many, very many, have fallen. \u2026 I can only say that it was a most desperate and daring attempt, and it was performed with as much gallantry and spirit as was ever shown by any troops in any age. \nThe army is in great spirits, and full of rage and ferocity at the rebellious rascals, who both poisoned and chewed the musket balls, in order to make them...more fatal. Many officers have died of their wounds, and others very ill: \u2019tis astonishing what a number of officers were hit on this occasion; but the officers were particularly aimed at.\" \nMonths after the battle, Waller evacuated Boston with the rest of the British Army on March 17, 1776, never to return.  \nUnlike Brown and Waller, Peter Salem\u2019s reflections of the battle remain unknown. Salem continued to serve until 1780, re-enlisting four times. He saw action in other significant Revolutionary battles such as Harlem Heights, Trenton, Saratoga, and Monmouth. What drove his desire to serve? Was he fighting for his own freedom? Or was it his hope that a new country, full of promise, might recognize his citizenship?  \nDespite conflicting accounts of British Major Pitcairn\u2019s fall, some people credited Peter Salem with firing the fatal shot. Peter Salem\u2019s role in Major Pitcairn\u2019s demise at Bunker Hill became an even more popular legend when American artist and veteran John Trumbull included a Black soldier, thought to be Salem, in his famous 1786 painting, The Battle of Bunker\u2019s Hill. As historians wrote accounts of the battle years later, some embraced this legend.  \nFor example, in Samuel Swett\u2019s 1826 History of Bunker Hill Battle: \n\"Among the foremost...leaders was...gallant Maj. Pitcairn, who exultingly cried \u201cthe day is ours,\u201d when Salem a black soldier, and a number of others, shot him through and he fell.\"\nIn that same year, Emory Washburn wrote in the Topographical and Historical Sketches of the Town of Leicester:  \n\"There was residing here, till within a few years, a black man, who, we have good reason to believe, was the one who shot Maj. Pitcairn, whose death forms so affecting an incident in that bloody affray. History relates that he was shot by a negro, and from the story of the one we allude to, and many corroborating circumstances, we are led to conclude that he was the person who did the deed. The person to whom we refer was named Peter Salem; he was a servant of Gen. [John] Nixon during the revolution, was a native of Framingham, and removed here a few years since, where he died.\"\nWhile historians still debate the events of the day, Peter Salem\u2019s legacy and memory extended beyond the man. Yet he was just a man who dedicated years of his life to the service of this new country, never experiencing fame himself.  \nJosiah Howard Temple\u2019s History of Framingham, Massachusetts reminds us of the man behind the legend...\nPeter Salem died in 1816 in Framingham. As pensions were not granted to Revolutionary War veterans until 1818, Peter Salem, like many of his fellow service members, died in poverty.",

Its speech will be of patriotism and courage; of civil and religious liberty; of free government; of the moral improvement and elevation of mankind; and of the immortal memory of those who with heroic devotion have sacrificed their lives for their country.\nThose who dedicated the monument in 1843 echoed a heroic memory of the battle to shape their legacy. Others have since critiqued or redefined the memory and meaning of the battle and the monument for themselves. Even within days of the dedication ceremony, The Liberator criticized Webster\u2019s speech, printing:\nIt is deeply to be regretted, nay deeply to be lamented, that Mr. Webster could allow such an occasion to pass without once alluding to the startling fact\u2014a fact which makes us blush as we press the soil of Bunker Hill and gaze upon its granite Monument\u2014that there are in the boasted country of freedom OVER THREE MILLIONS OF SLAVES!\nListen to the words of others who have also questioned the meaning of the monument and consider:\nWhat memories does the monument evoke for you?\nHow might they inspire future action?",

When you get out of the car, the visitor center will be to your left up a small incline accessed via a red asphalt trail. The small visitor center features a bookstore, several interpretive panels and a model of how the church may once have looked.

The approach to the building itself is a wide brick walkway with a slight incline. It turns to the right as you near the building; here there are three flag poles displaying, from left to right, the Louisiana state flag, the United States flag and the flag of Acadiana. On either side are green plants, trees and grasses. In season, there are lavender azaleas. As you enter through the front door, you are in a large, high-ceilinged room with several square pillars spaced throughout. From that position, there are the following points of interest: Ten feet ahead is the information desk, staffed by a park ranger. To the right, 25 feet away is the counter for the book store. The book store has tables and shelves with a variety of products including books and toys. To your left, roughly 60 feet away, is the museum. The museum exhibits are related to Cajun culture, displaying clothing, fishing equipment and musical instruments, among other items. At the 1:00 position is the entrance to the theater, 30 feet away. The theater has 175 seats with a movie screen at the front of the room. At roughly the 10:00 position, you\u2019ll find the bathroom vestibule, 45 feet away. There is one, single-occupancy bathroom available to visitors; once you enter the vestibule, turn left and walk along a wall to your left to the bathroom door ahead. (You will pass a closest door on your left before reaching the bathroom.) As you navigate your surroundings, keep in mind that there are pillars spaced at regular intervals around the space.",

A brick sidewalk runs through the yard, and they may stop and read waysides or walk through the open first floor of the home, which contains exhibits pertaining to Johnson's early life. When the visitor reaches College Street, they will find a crosswalk with a sign advising on-coming traffic to stop for pedestrians, as it is mid-street and not at the designated corner cross-walk. Visitors may choose to cross at either location, but ensure that traffic has come to a stop before proceeding at both. The restrooms and water fountains will be on your right as you walk toward the main Visitor Center entrance. The double doors into the Visitor Center are manually automatic.

                "audioDescription": "The Arches National Park Visitor center is located just beyond the park entrance off of highway 191 North of Moab, UT. The building and parking lot sit at the base of towering sandstone walls formed by the Moab fault. Beyond the turn into the parking lot, the park road snakes up and above the visitor center, which leads to the rest of the park atop the plateau. Once past the entrance booths, a right turn after the roundabout leads to the parking lot and visitor center. The parking lot is spacious, with a small shade structure and picnic tables on its Northwest side. The visitor center building is located to the right-- northeast of the lot. The building itself is multi-storied and angular, painted different shades of beige, tan, and light maroon. In front of the building is an extensive interpretive plaza, shaded by two columns of ramada style roofing, one running along the Northwest side of the plaza, the other, along the Southeast. Each section is held up by several sandstone brick pillars. In the center of these two shaded sections sits a series of decorative boulders and bronze statues of wildlife. Restrooms and other amenities are located just beyond these statues along the northeast wall. The overall low profile of the building and shade structures gives the sense that the structure is part of the colorful sandstone layers located beyond and above it. Scanning the Interpretive plaza clockwise from the parking lot, several trash and recycling bins are visible near the leftmost brick pillar. The following pillar features two water filling stations, a spicket and informational panel on each side. The next pillar, which extends back towards the visitor center entrance in the northeast corner of the plaza, features a large NPS Arrowhead and the words \u2018Arches National Park.\u2019 The remaining two pillars curve towards the building entrance and feature large informational panels about wildlife and park features respectively. A section of windows with two double doors on the left marks the entrance to the visitor center building. Continuing to the right, the northeast wall of the plaza features a low bench, payphones, trashcan, and a shaded alcove with access to two gendered and one handicapped accessible family restroom. Opposite the first column of pillars, a second shade structure runs East to south. Underneath the structure, the pillars feature additional informational panels; \u201cClimbing and Canyoneering,\u201d \u201cWhat to do at Arches,\u201d \u201cPark Features,\u201d and a gold lettered quote that reads: \u201cExtraordinary arches, awe-inspiring landscapes.\u201d Closer to the parking lot, the last two pillars also feature low benches. A flagpole with a raised American Flag stands closest to the road on the sidewalk before the parking lot. In the center of the plaza are several large rocks and life-sized bronze statues of wildlife in Arches. The floor beneath these statues is characterized by a sweeping patch of rough, light gray cement, in contrast to the smooth orange cement of the rest of the plaza. A male bighorn sheep sits atop the largest rock, a small lizard and two ravens perch on a neighboring boulders. A female bighorn sheep and baby stand closest to the parking lot, another lizard on a smaller rock behind them. Past these statues, one enters to visitor center through the double doors in the northernmost corner of the visitor center plaza. The entryway leads to a large mural of delicate arch, flanked by two digital trip planning kiosks. Directly in front of this mural is a large three dimensional relief map of the park at about waist height. To the left of this map is the park store. Several kiosks and display shelves are present in the entry way of the store. To the right of the relief map is the visitor center information desk. Behind the desk are panels with photographs of different prominent rock features in the park. To the right, a small inlet against the large windows facing the plaza holds two televisions mounted to each wall, used for orientation and safety videos. To the left of the information desk is the exhibit hall, which leads to various exhibits on the geology, environment, wildlife, and history of the park. The exhibit hall features a large two story window that looks up towards the sandstone wall behind the visitor center, and several large scale models of arches and sandstone features weave throughout the exhibits. On the far end of the exhibit hall sits the entryway to the theater, which seats 114 persons for showings of the park film.",

This section is 40 ft. to the wooden deck in front of the visitor center. The deck is level. The visitor center is 40 ft. ahead. Entry is through glass doors into a small foyer then about 6 ft. to a second set of glass doors. The ranger's desk is directly ahead about 8 ft. To the right is a museum, with exhibits of the geology, biology, natural history, and human history of the Barataria region. The museum has a wide entrance and is about 20 ft. from the ranger's desk. The exhibits are along the walls and in a large island in the middle of the museum holding more exhibits. A few of the exhibits are equipped with sound; most are not. Also in the visitor center is a theater. Entry to the theater is through a door that is immediately to the right of the entrance. The theater is entered by making a right U-turn after entering the visitor center. The restrooms are outside the visitor center in a separate building. Leave the visitor center through the glass doors and turn sharply right. The building with the restrooms is about 40 ft. away. The men's room is the nearest on the left side of the building, and the women's restroom is on the right. In between are a large drinking fountain and entrance to a handicapped/family restroom. Also between the visitor center and the building with the restrooms are two picnic tables, both closer to the visitor center than to the restroom.",

A wheel chair accessible ramp and push button door opener (door swings out) allow entry to the building lobby from the off-street parking area on the right side of the building. There is a handicap parking area right beside this ramp. Public restrooms are located just off the lobby on the left of the main door -- to reach, turn left, walk to the end of the lobby, turn right and walk about 10 steps where you will pass through an open archway. Turn left, and step forward -- the men's restroom is straight ahead, and the women's is on the left. Handicap stalls and diaper changing locations are available in both facilities. The visitor information center is to the right of the main door -- walk to the end of the lobby, turn left and walk forward past the handicap accessible door and through a single wide door into the visitor information center. This is a single room with touchable exhibits and an information desk. This center is often a self-service facility, but if the ranger or volunteer is there you can ask for a recorded self-guided tour of the various exhibits inside the building.",

Across the parking lot on the Visitor Center's eastern wall, there is a tan concrete welcome sign with the National Park Service logo and the text \"Welcome to the Ben Reifel Visitor Center.\" The main entrance is on the west side of the building, with a secondary entrance on the south side. On the southwest corner of the building, the text \"Ben Reifel Visitor Center\" is written in metal letters and affixed to the building. The main entrance leads to a lobby-area accommodating at most twelve people at a time. On one side is a curved information desk with a large map showing the locations of visitor services and animals within the park. On the other side is the park bookstore with a variety of souvenir and educational items for sale. At the northeast corner of the room there is a darkly light pathway that leads to exhibits about the park's resources. Beside that is the entrance to the theater. The southeast corner of the lobby leads to a hallway with three doors, in succession from north to south, they are the men's restroom, the women's restroom, and the entrance to the fossil preparation laboratory where visitors can observe and interact with paleontology technicians as they prepare fossils throughout the park.

The main campground road leads south from the entrance to a small parking area in front of a single-story rectangular building with a low peaked roof. The building is painted pale yellow and the roof has bright red shingles. There is a set of 6 stairs with a center handrail that lead up to the building\u2019s entrance. The building may also be accessed without stairs by using a sidewalk on the west side. The entrance to the building is a single swinging door that opens out. The entrance door leads to a hallway. On the right side of the hallway is a counter where rangers greet visitors and provide information. On the left is a closed door that leads to a conference room and a large map mounted to the wall showing trails in the area. After the counter on the right is the entrance to a small gift shop that sells books and souvenirs. After the entrance to the gift shop on the right is a display window with information about the current exhibit. Past the display window and also on the right is a water fountain and bottle fill station. Across from the display window, on the left side of the entry way is a bench with 2 seats separated by a low table and another closed door that leads to the conference room. The entry way has an exit door opposite the entrance door which opens out to a sandy staff parking area. Passing straight through the gift shop is a small gallery. The walls and ceiling are made of wooden planks, art is displayed on white exhibit boards. There is a low bench with three seats in the center of the room. The gallery changes three times a year to feature work from the park\u2019s artists in residence and local students. Continuing straight through the gallery along the right-hand wall is a low ramp with a handrail on the left side. Up the ramp and to the left is a hallway with two single occupancy bathrooms on the left side of the hallway.",
